Review,Score"The pizza here is really excellent. It serves as a very good substitute if the wait is too long, or if you get sick of the slightly better pizza, at Adrienne's nearby.Much like Adrienne's, the best thing to get here is the Old-Fashioned Square Pie. They have most of the typical toppings you could want to load it up with. I usually like a nice meaty one, and they top it pretty well with adequate pepperoni and sausage. Some slices are lacking a bit sometimes, but overall it's pretty solid.The other food here is pretty good as well. I've tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parm, which both provide for a satisfying meal.I often order up from here, but the dine-in experience is good too. It's a nice, dark atmosphere with decent service. This is one of the few really good choices for both a nice meal out, or ordering in if you are in the Financial District.",0.005415472"Good coffee but not worth the hype. Seriously. Try Ninth Street Espresso (East Village) or Birch (27th & Madison) and tell me coffee there is better than here. Did not like the attitude of the barista, maybe he was having a bad day or just sick of making coffee all day. He was talking on the phone, not attentive and the person ahead of me was pissed off.",0.226675768"We wanted to try some good Italian while in NYC so we looked at the ZAGAT list of best restaurants in town. We decided on Pepolino based on their online menu, which turned out to be outdated. Regardless of this initial setback, we were happy with our choice. We started ordering the polenta. I'm not a fan of polenta, but the sauce was so good the polenta was barely noticeable! My brother ordered the spinach and ricotta gnocchi with butter and sage sauce. I wanted to try the gnocchi as well, but having tried butter sauces from several upscale restaurants in the last few months, I was hesitant. Butter sauces I had tried before were just too buttery and made me sick. So I asked for a creamy sauce instead. The chef was hesitant about the change but was willing to accommodate. When our dishes were served, I tried the butter and sage sauce from my brother's gnocchi and it was really good!  Nothing like the other sauces I had tried before. I hereby apologize to the chef for replacing his brilliant choice of sauce. However, the creamy sauce I got instead was also really good. It might have a lot to do with the fact that the gnocchi itself was outstanding. Having a chef being flexible with picky eaters like myself is definitely appreciated. For dessert we tried the panna cotta. The sauce was supposed to be strawberry, but you couldn't really tell.",0.228524372"Honestly, the quality of soup is just not that good. Tasted like the stuff my mom made me out of the can when I was sick. I was disappointed at the rude service and I can't say that I will come back any time soon.",0.172769563This really small restaurant has the best (real) Mexican tacos in NYC. I'm not kidding. My boyfriend and I started this quest over a year ago and we finally found this place! Are you home sick and want those tacos? Come here!,0.142351573"I love this place! Its very hard to find good authentic Vietnamese restaurants especially a place that serves good pho. The food at Pho Bang is amazing. I bring all my friends here and they love it too. It's super cheap and I love getting the pho, summer rolls and spring rolls. I come here very often and I never get sick of it.",0.005472913"Sometime later on in the evening we would have went to watch a friend of a friend perform. We went to two other places by in hopes that we would grab a quick bite to eat. We ended up coming back here when the two others were packed and no room to even squeeze in another party of five even in the midst of crowds. We realized, holy damn! We should've came here in the first place. Sports bar with large TV screens everywhere. (It doesn't matter where you sit -- you'll have a good view.) The place was clean and food wasn't the best I've had in bars, but a lot better than other sports bars I've been to. We had a sample platter, sliders, and nacho dips. The platter came with 7 spring rolls (my boss counted bc he loves spring rolls), nicely sized chicken strips, calamari, wings, and one more thing I think? Food did not disappoint at all. The sliders were juicy and tasty as they were--didn't even need to add condiments to spice it up. Our waitress was Elizabeth and she did an awesome job with the 6 of us. Quick speedy service, great demeanor, great customer service, went along with our shenanigans when we were joking around, and had such great memory of what our drinks were. She came around every now and then and would just ask ""do you want another [insert drink name]"" without asking you to repeat what you ordered 20 minutes ago. This girl deserves a raise for her excellent service skills. Not just because she remembered our drinks but her entire service with us was great. Only downside to this place is that it is way too loud at the bar. You scream and still can't hear each other.What we really came for was the band. Who knew there was a live alternative rock band playing somewhere on 2nd ave? Kudos to the band for an awesome time.  Great song covers and surely got the crowd going with those familiar tunes. Though I wish they rocked out Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit instead of mashing it with Nirvana's other songs. So.... All you bands out there.. This is a great place to rock out. You get a wonderful crowd, good food, and a sick location in Manhattan to do so. Good times spent here and will return.",0.047084743"Totally bland. I was craving udon so I had the noodle soup with tofu, spinach and mushrooms. It came in a huge bowl of what was basically just hot water. The tofu was raw and tasted like, well, tofu. This is fine in something like a miso soup in which the base actually has some flavor, but in this soup it was just insulting. Hubs ordered the lotus root and chili pepper but there were no peppers to be seen anywhere. Again, zero flavor. The veggie dumplings were ok once you dipped them in the sauce, but were otherwise meh. I'm so sick of chefs who think vegetarians must not like their food to taste like anything. I mean, who do they think they are catering to?",0.064373946"I came for the cupcakes long ago b/c of SATC, but the cupcakes were dry and the frosting was sickly sweet.  It's also overpriced. So 1 star for cupcakes.Recently a friend hosted a party in which he served Magnolia's apple crumble, which was surprisingly scrumptious.  I went today to try this crumble again and found it cost $4 for a tiny little round tin of it that looked like it had seen better days.  No thanks, love, not today.1 star cupcake + 3 star apple crumble / 2 = 2 star review.  You're welcome.",0.075628262"Food is great in concept. I have been wanting to go here for several months, but we haven't had the time. Our first and only visit: Food looked great & staff was amazing. But, I found a hair in my food, and our whole family has been sick ever since we ate lunch there. Hopefully it was just an ""off"" day for the kitchen staff...",0.453515161"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My dad and I were meeting for a quick bite to eat super early in the morning on a Sunday, prior to a shuttle ride to the airport. You would be surprised how many places in this area are closed early Sunday morning that won't give you food poisoning. So my dad and I were excited to find a semi-decent looking place that could meet our needs. Except for the fact that this place did not meet our needs, in fact it left us standing on the streets of New York at 7:00am needing to reroute our morning plans because Liberty Diner doesn't feel the need to update their website to the fact that they are not open ""7am-2am Everyday!"" as cleverly advertised on their website.When I called to question this later in the evening I was told they ""eventually planned to be open at 7am, and that they open at 11am"" Why is this not updated on the website? I ask. ""Ohh we did the paperwork"" I don't know what that means, but what I do know is that if you are not open at 7am, you sure as hell should not be advertising that you are. If they don't care enough about posting the correct dining times on-line, that speaks volumes as to how much they care about the customers, food, and service. Liberty Diner take some responsibility and change your times, and advertising. This is literally the equivalent to a 200 pound person, saying that they are 100 pounds and then, when they are questioned on it saying one day they plan on losing 100 pounds, so in the mean time they are telling everyone they are only 100 pounds. Idiots.",0.066288282"I've lived in this neighborhood for a while, so when I heard a real coffee shop was opening up I was quite the excited little girl. I hurried on over for my first latte a week into it's opening. I ordered a large skim latte. To which the owner of the shop responded. ""Skim- like skim milk? I'm sorry I don't speak Starbucks."" Not only was I insulted, but completely embarrassed for him. Who doesn't understand what Skim is? It's literally in the title of the milk. Regardless, I brushed it off.I watched him pull the shot for my latte, which clearly was an over extracted and completely uneven shot. Still I have it a go. It was alright- not awful enough to spit out, and the milk covers up bad shots anyhow. I thought I'd be insightful and ask what coffee they use for their shots. He responded by a short ""Colombia."" Which definitely wasn't enough for me to understand the roaster, or even which Colombia. So I politely asked if he knew which roaster it came from. He quickly responded ""Yes. I do."" After a literal 1 minute pause, I asked ""Well...are you going to tell me?"" And he quickly again responded. ""No.""It was mind blowing to hear that. Soon after he asked ""What're you asking for?"" I let him know I work as a barista. He paused again, asking ""What? Dunkin Donuts?"" It was simply too much for me. I corrected him by telling him actually for a pretty successful cafe in Tribeca. End result, he is completely unprofessional. Clearly a terrible barista. You think a regular barista who can actually pull a decent shot is pretentious? Imagine one who can't even distribute correctly enough to pull a non-watery shot and is pretentious- it makes me feel sick. Will I go by once in a blue for a latte without giving him eye contact? Yup- sure will. It's my only choice for right now. I'm going to invest in an espresso machine for home.",0.047660977"The cheese fondue is only topped by the chocolate fondue, which ranks only slightly below the cocktails, each of which should be sampled, preferably the evening you decide to write a Yelp review.I mostly love this place. There are some downsides, but they're not unique to BP. It's a tiny space and a crowded area, so getting a seat is a little hit or miss. It's also small enough that when someone gets a little sick and shares that piquant melange of chocolate, liqueur and stomach bile with the bathroom floor, it kind of sticks with the place for the rest of the evening. And it's a place popular with young enough people that this tends to happen a little too often. Still though? It gets sincere thumbs up for me. Cozy feel, delicious food, quiet enough you can hear your date think.",0.019261057"My husband and I have been going to and ordering take out from Georgio's for about a decade.  I can't believe I'm reviewing it for the first time now.  It's just one of those places that always tries to please its customers, so you just keep going and enjoying it but never write about it. We went today, and I said, we should really review this place. So, here it is: this place is very good.  The best things about this place are:- The food is good/safe (never been sick from food here, and the fries today looked really fresh like the oil had just been changed)- The service is very smooth - the servers are always accommodating requests- The owner/manager (I should know his name already) is really accommodating and aiming to please customers.  He's truly a smart businessman and very pleasant natured- The fresh squeezed juices and oreo heaven shake are delicious (I haven't had any other shakes)- The food is like a diner but the atmosphere is more ""country""- The bathroom is always clean (huge plus in my book, especially in nyc where a majority of bathrooms - even in more expensive restaurants - are disgusting)- the delivery is always quick and if I've had problem, they've remedied itThe not so great thing about this place is that the food is not excellent.  It's very good to good.  I don't love the way they make omelets, and I almost always want an omelet when we go out for breakfast.  They're a little too well done for me.  The burgers are good and the fries are usually delicious.  I've tried other menu items and I don't remember them.  I haven't had the bbq sauce in a while (maybe 5 years,) but I remember not loving it.Like i said, it's very much like a diner with ""country kitchen"" kitsch.

Alone or with friends, the garden is amazing.  I really enjoy the place.  The  baked scotcht egg and the baby crab cakes are great appetizers or just to have a nosh. This true gastro pub offers great British fare, I particularly love the salads --the King George being my favorite-- and the &#34;Guvnor&#34; sandwich. The Yorkshire Pudding is to die for. If you love desert, you cannot miss the Pears on Port wine. This jewel is more than a bar and is very reasonable. I suggest you make it your hang our even if you do not live in the hood.

I lived in NYC for 7 years and now in San Francisco, and trying different burger joints was probably the foodie trend that I enjoyed the most. But my heart always returns to Paul's. Maybe because it was a few blocks from my dorm when I was a freshmen at NYU. Maybe it was because after being there countless times, I've only been served by the same two waitresses. Maybe because their prices are so cheap. Maybe because they once delivered my order to Soho even though I was under the $10 limit because I was too busy to get up there. Maybe because sometimes you just want a giant, juicy, greasy burger and you're sick of this grass-fed 4 oz house made ketchup bull shit on an english muffin. Maybe because, despite the tourists and NYU students, the regulars there are also cops, firemen, and blue collar New Yorkers who need a real burger.

Maybe I'm just a true Organic Avenue lover, but Liquiteria is just not my cup of juice. Granted, they have a wide variety of juices and other things like food, snacks, packaged goods, and even fresh, made on the spot, cold-pressed juices and smoothies; versus OA which only offers bottled beverages and food. This place is very vibrantly colored and decorated. Definitely the most lively colored juice bar! As for the juice itself, it's delicious, and large. I was surprised that a sickly shade of brown that I was drinking was surprisingly sweet (and yummy for that matter).

The place is on a strip of Ludlow, where there seems to be a lot of hipsters. The restaurant really isn't that big but it is a long restaurant. On the night we went, it was brick outside, so it was relatively slow, but great for our party since we were probably the loudest people there lol In terms of food, I think the small plates were the clear winners. Also, the Ginga Kogen, which is like Hefe Weizen, is exceptional. It's according to the table as very ""refreshing."" The food:Egg on Egg on Egg- sea urchin, sturgeon caviar over a bed of scrambled eggs. This dish kinda signified everything good and holy in this world. LOL The dish was good, but I feel the scrambled egg with a slight kick from the Uni were the predominant flavors. I barely noticed the caviar at all. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=spQBVg_hNazyU1sV6vuSqw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlATsukune- chicken meat ball, foie gras with poached egg. I am a sucker for Japanese chicken meat balls and this is one of the best I ever had. The inside was perfectly juicy and so tender.

I thought it was going to be blah, oh no it wasn't.Uni Crostini- torched uni and Parmesan Reggiano flakes. As much as I liked this dish, I felt like it was kinda cheating. Torched Uni on anything woulda made it good. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TR6cftV9yLRF6GdwYrqKTg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlASecreto Iberico Pork- Farro salad with kogashi shoyu. I don't really eat farro but I really liked it. The pork was cooked nicely, but I do wish it was slightly more tender.

Meh, they were OK, at least they didn't put lettuce in it(I hate lettuce in my pork buns) I felt like the pork was missing the fattiness and it was slightly chewier that what I was expecting. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4k7KZEmEsZ-ICkCY9z4wzQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlAOctopus- pickled celery, zucchini and shio kombu. I thought this dish was nice, the octopus was nice and tender. The dish is served cold and the zucchini works nicely. Burgundy Truffle & Market Vegetables- string beans, snap peas, butternut squash, radicchios, endives in a truffle soy vinaigrette. I thought this dish was a little odd that it was cold. Guess I was expecting it to be hot. The massive chunks of truffle are pretty sick though. It was a nice dish, but not a wow dish.Daikon Mochi- bacon, Miyabi nori with wasabi pickled Kyoto greens. This dish was not my fav, this dish really reminded me of Spanish arepitas.

It's a pretty dish, but I was kinda disappointed. This is kinda the go to dish for modern Asian places and it was just OK for me. I wasn't impressed with the orange rind or orange reduction. The taste of the fish was slightly off putting and the glaze was kinda too sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zVM_SNj1IiFlYWRMAmroMg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlABronzino Confit- Yuza creamed collard greens, daikon, red radish and mentai yogurt.

I probably wouldn&#39;t get the pre packaged sushi that&#39;s covered in condensation on a Sunday afternoon, but honestly, who would? However I am sick and tired of the poor customer service. I work at a hotel on 44th street and have been going to caf? 45 for over two years now (two to three times a week). At every other restaurant, deli, and pizza joint in the area I will be greeted with a warm welcome (or at least a hello). At caf? 45 I feel like I am somehow a burden to the staff and my ordering a sandwich has in some way wasted their time. This Sunday I was one of two people in the place. They had three guys behind the counter, a woman at the register on her cell, and another guy cleaning the counter. It took them almost ten minutes for them to acknowledge me, let alone take my order. I handed them a written order from a coworker and then gave mine (three times because he was too busy talking to his buddy behind the counter to listen to me). I paid my bill (which was a little pricey for two sandwiches and a bag of chips) and made my way back to work. Only to find that they had added items to the order I handed to them and forgot items on the one I voiced to them. Sadly, this is not the first time I&#39;ve had this happen and honestly it&#39;s my own fault for ever going back after the first dozen screwed up orders. From now on I will be taking my business next door to Ambrosia or to City Caf? on 43rd street. Both of those establishments have never screwed up an order; have a much friendlier staff, and the same (if not better) quality of food.

Someone mentioned it in a previous review and I should've listened. They try to keep the place tidy, but as a person who values cleanliness, I was not happy. The walls look stained, the corners of the floors looked sticky and clumpy as if they haven't been mopped in months. Take a look at the fire extinguisher on the floor by the kitchen, it's disgusting! The booths were dirty and the place smelled moldy! It was a weird stench but I recognized it as soon as I walked in, almost like an old abandoned mildew-filled home.  If a place doesn't put effort into making their establishment spotless, can you imagine how they handle your food behind closed doors? Especially Sushi which requires a lot more TLC. The ambiance was completely dead and they don't even have background music. This place needs severe renovation. The servers were forgettable and did not go out of their way to be friendly. Yes, the sushi itself was decent. Yes, I was hungry. Yes, I worried about food poisoning. Yes, I'm ashamed I ate there.. but what's a girl to do? Yes, I will NOT eat there again! I would've given it 1 star but bc the sushi itself was pretty good and I didn't die of food poisoning, I gave it 2. That's good right?",0.313130436"Honestly this place would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for what happened today. Won't say that its a horrible place because that would be a lie. Ever since Tomo opened in my area I instantly started buying food there. Let's just say sometimes I bought food from Tomo on a 3 time a week basis. The driver already recognized my face and so did the staff at the restaurant, they always said hello when they saw me at the restaurant. When I didn't order in a while, some staff would tell me, ""hi long time, how have you been?"" Yes I ordered that much! Around April of this year I ordered some sushi, ate it and it was yummy as usual! The next day I had to call out of work because I was so ill with food poisoning. Despite of this I still ordered food from here. I even moved to another neighborhood and still ordered from there. I ordered some Philadelphia rolls today and asked for the salmon to be cooked.(The salmon is smoked) I don't like to eat anything raw. When I received the sushi some parts of the salmon looked cooked while others were raw. I called back and let them know. I was told that it was cooked and that there was no way it was not.  I felt like they really didn't care after all the business that I have given. My orders were big and not less than 25 dollars most of the time. Considering that and the fact they already recognized me I thought the would fix this by simply sending my order how I asked for it. I asked the lady over the phone to remove my info as I no longer want to do business with them. She replied with a simple, ""ok we will remove."" The reason I asked for this is because they had a habit of leaving my credit cards on file. When they would print the receipt my full credit card number would be on there! So yes they lost a customer, a really good one I truly made lots of business for them! Doesn't take away from their great food but it's also about CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",0.277504185"Yo: this place is a tourist trap! (If you're a tourist, just do it.  You don't really have a choice.  I understand, and I'll forgive you one day.  And besides, if you weren't packed in here with all 17 of your friends celebrating someone's 32nd birthday, I wouldn't be able to call this place a tourist trap.  So... thank you?) The most popular menu item is a ""goblet.""  There is a whole look of goblets, which are basically ice, sugar, candy, juice, and probably a shot of some fruit-flavored liquor.  One of those drinks that's fun to instagram but will just fill you up and make you sick without getting you even tipsy.Of course, there were a lot of birthday parties going on... this place would be great if you are celebrating something that needs a gimmick.My friend and I each had one martini -- we came when Sugar Factory was new and we like to stay on top of the Meatpacking scene.  I had the Reese's, which was rimmed with peanut butter and actually tasted like a Reese's.  I was pleased.  Her drink was the Chocolate Covered Strawberry.  She found it so sweet she had to water it down to drink it.We had our drinks and then got the heck out of there.  The tables were so uncomfortably close together I was practically eating the fries of the guy next to me.  Glad to have visited, but I won't be back.",0.020631517"They deserve every terrible review written. I am very sick and made an order of chicken noodle soup among other things.I tried to pay via credit card - they dont accept credit card via the phone.

My tale of filth is shocking but true. Even as I think about what just happened to me, I gag a little. Well, gulp, here we go:""Bugs & Death Threats: a Culinary Experience at Crown""It's Sunday, Week 2 of the football season. I am ready to pigout with some cold beer and some fried chicken with sides. Yum. I remembered that a new chicken place had opened up that offered delivery. They had slipped a menu under my door this week so I mistakenly decided to give them a whirl. The food looked standard and the prices were fair. I called for a delivery but they dont deliver despite what the menu said. Fine, I won't fault them, they just opened. The horror began when I picked up my order. First the place was slammed with ghetto people yelling and putting on a show. I'm used to this type of thing since I have lived around here for 6 years. But what caught my eye were the flies that were all over the place. I didn't think much till I got home...When I got home, to my horror, I noticed  there were bugs all over my ""food"". Both flies and roaches. I literally got sick in the bag when I saw the abortion that was inside... Thank god I didn't take a bite or I would have fallen into a shock induced coma. The ""chicken"" was so swarmed with bugs that it looked like a prop from the film Beetlejuice.  Seriously, there were 4 or five visible bugs. I wish I took a picture but instinct kicked in and I ran the ""food"" to trash compactor before I thought to take a picture. Taste: So I can't comment on the taste of the food because I don't eat vermin for health reasons. But I assume that living bugs would provide a unique culinary experience. Nino provided awesome customer service to rectify the situation. First he cursed me out denying that he has ever seen a bug in the restaurant. Even as he yelled flies swarmed around the pizza like they do around the face of a starving third world child. (that was not PC but necessary)  Then he threatened my life if I was to post this on yelp. Me: ""get ready to be blasted on the net"" nino: ""I'll f*cking kill you if you post this"" me: ""are u gonna refund my money"" nino ""get the f*ck outta here before I kick your ass."" So i guess I am literally risking my life to pass this info along. (Your welcome yelp.) Don't worry concerned citizens of NYC, I've called 311. Hopefully they will shut this disaster down. BTW. Kissena diner just 2 doors away has been shut down because of bug/verman issues, so I am not suprised they are having this problem, but they just opened for godsake. The way they dealt with the situation was so unprofessional but may have been caused by the fact that half the people waiting for food canceled their orders as I recounted my experience and asked for a refund. Please if you love your family and do not want your little ones to get the bubonic plague. Don't eat here. Nothing positive to say.I nominate this unique eatery as the filthiest restaurant in NYC. I would rather eat a shepards pie off the floor of the 1 train before I try their food. All kidding aside yelpers take caution.",0.166761026"My 9 year old daughter and I went there yesterday. It was an emergency she was feeling ill and asked to use their bathroom. I offered to purchase something in order to compensate since most place do not allow you to use their facilities without purchase.They flat out refused. They did not care that this little girl was sick, they wanted no part of it and asked us to leave. THEY WERE INCREDIBLY RUDE! NOT CHILD FRIENDLY.

Them I moved to New Jack City and experienced some of the corner bodegas making fresh salads as you choose the toppings. Then I tried chop't, tossed, Just Salad and Sweet Greens as I am always eating a healthy lunch. All those roads led me down this path to the Mecca of salad customization. Their dressings are delicious, their proteins are all fresh, filled with flavor and nutrition.  I actually laugh at the selection at the other places... Fried chicken at chop't? Disgusting. You can tell all of the meats and half of the other toppings at the chain locations are prepared so that they can be dispersed from one location and last in the fridge for up to 14 days!

It was the photo of the toilet seat. I just had to see it for myself. This is how immature I am. Also, someone's picture of the Spicy Tuna Salsa roll basically sold it.Regardless! This place is awesome. Pretty cozy, not a huge amount of seating.. I'd say maybe 20 tables tops. We went around 8 pm on a Saturday, thinking it was going to be packed like the other sushi places by us, but it wasn't, thankfully. There were a good amount of full tables when we got there but nothing crazy. We were sat immediately and also helped immediately, which was awesome. We ordered edamame and some wine and I ordered the Spicy Tuna Salsa roll (spicy tuna, mango, peanuts,...possibly avocado?, wrapped in rice and seaweed and then fried in tempura topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce...holy YUM). I also got a crunchy spicy salmon roll. There were only 6 pieces to the hand roll, which was a little disappointing because I feel like usually there's 8, but I ate enough edamame to make up for it. The service was great. It took a little longer to make the rolls that I thought it would but it was nice to just sit and relax and enjoy the company without feeling like we were being rushed out of the restaurant. The ambience was nice, too. Not too bright, not too dark. I'll definitely be coming back here again, it was awesome.And you gotta see that toilet seat.",0.07166136"I am a big fan of Subway and go to a Subway for lunch at least 4 days a week. This location has failed so bad. I felt the need to write in to ""report"" how they are failing on the Subway website. Below is what I wrote to corporate:I almost always get a Veggie Delite salad, or sometimes turn a Spicy Italian into a Salad. Every once in a while when a new sandwich comes out, I will give it a try.Today I decided to get an Eggplant Parmesan  Footlong and a Spicy Italian Salad. The woman that helped me did not use a knife to cut the bread but instead tore it open using her bare hands (no gloves). I decided not to get the sandwich after seeing that and proceeded to order the salad. The lettuce was not fresh, and I guess it was rinsed in water in the morning when they put in in the case as it was soggy and dripping. The spinach was withered and most of the veggies were mixed up with other veggies. This is a problem for me as I am allergic to red onions. I let her finish the salad, but once I took it home I had to throw it away as there were 2 pieces of onions, and after seeing the withered spinach and soggy lettuce I was concerned that I might get sick from the lack of freshness.Please please please, talk to this franchise owner. This locations needs to be trained on how to keep the veggies fresh and their workstation clean. Overall food safety training might improve this location alot.

I was visiting the City the opening weekend of this establishment and decided to come with my mother because the atmosphere looks great and it's down the block from where I grew up. The place gets 2 stars mainly for the feel and decent waiters.Where to start about how unimpressed I was? First, the menu needs some tweaking to get it into the ""tavern feel"". They need to really zone in the kind of cuisine they want to serve not all of the above like I saw: Tex-Mexican, Traditional-American, Southern Comfort Food, etc.  I had a chicken sandwich and it lacked seasoning. The way the sandwich was organized, it wasn't layered properly. Usually when you bite into a good sandwich, each time you get a bite of the meat, lettuce, tomato and sauce. This was completely just off. My mother had the fried chicken with mash potatoes...this was an epic fail. The chicken came out RAW. The meat was clearly pink and needed a few more to cook. Raw chicken carries Salmonella which can get a person very sick for days. I informed the waiter about this and they took the plate away to do something. The next round that came out, was extremely over cooked and the batter was under seasoned. Someone needs to go into that kitchen and give the chef a bottle of Lawry salt and a thermometer to get that chicken right!  The Chinese take out place across the street from there makes better chicken and it's half the price for x2 the quantity. I was a little irked that they didn't even offer a complimentary drink for serving my mother RAW chicken but hey, there needs to be improvement to the staff in customer service.Hopefully, they have some major improvements in the quality of food because this place will not be in business for long.",0.015588981"It cracks me up, the reviewers on here talking about getting snobby service at this place; get real!

Mr.Chow is out of your league! Unless you have the cash to strut through those doors like an absolute Boss, don&#39;t complain about anything, because Mr.Chow isn&#39;t here to make you feel special.

We prefer the pork dumplings to the crab & pork dumplings, but both are fantastic!  A word of caution to any first-timers: The soup inside of these dumplings  is very hot!  The way I eat them is to place the dumpling onto my soup spoon, then pierce or carefully bite the top of the dumpling to allow some of the steam to escape.  Then, you can add some of the ginger soy sauce provided for an extra element of flavor.  Make sure you don't just pop the dumpling into your mouth whole otherwise you will scorch yourself!I also enjoy the crispy dough, the salt soy bean milk, the dumplings in peanut sauce, the spicy beef tripe salad and the crispy noodles.  The staff are friendly and they always remember us and know what we want.  The restaurant has recently expanded, so they have three adjacent seating areas and can accommodate large parties.  They are also open early and close late, so you can go whenever you have a craving for soup dumplings.  Most important to me, as my friends know, is hygiene.  Their food is clean and I have always left there feeling great (and I am very, very prone to getting sick after a bad meal).

I've been here at least 10-15 times in my life dating back to 2007 and each experience never EVER disappoints! It's always fun to come with a group of friends, especially when their main objective is to drink. Now time to give the real rundown from all of my Kenka wisdom and pass it down to the next generation.First, get here early! On weekdays (specifically M-Th), it usually doesn't get overly-crowded at the open at 6pm, but the crowd will build up FAST! You will usually get a seat if you get here by 6, but as the night progresses a wait builds up. As for weekends (specifically Friday and Saturday), the most popular days, there WILL be a crowd outside before 6pm, so get there early to put your name down if you don't want to wait. Small parties get in fairly quickly, but parties of 7+ can easily wait over an hour.Once you get in, you will notice nude photos on the wall and other interesting artifacts. It's a nice touch that peeks the interests of the curious, especially when drunk. On the menu, there are definitely some interesting tidbits and rules you should be VERY AWARE of as the night goes on. Some of those rules include no vomiting on the premises, no sake-bombs, no fighting, etc....the usual right? Any broken rules result in a $20 fine, so get that wallet ready if you're going to drink till your liver explodes because I've actually had a friend break one of those rules and pay up.If you're looking to celebrate and drink heavily, I highly recommend buying a bottle or a few bottles of the sake. Great way to lose your sobriety very quickly. In addition, there are the pitchers of beer you can get or for the more adventurous the ""snake shot"". YES ""snake shot""! There's an actual dead rattle snake inside the bottle they serve you with and it's some potent stuff. As for food, there's plenty to mention, but some of my favorites include the french fries (with ketchup and mayo) and anything chicken, just to keep it simple. If you're looking to challenge someone, then by all means order the bull penis and turkey testicles. Call it very bizarre as many will, but they actually are quite appetizing, if unappealing. However, if you're looking to ""eat"" here, maybe those 2 items shouldn't be on your mind.If you do stay here all night till close to 4am (closing), which I have done on multiple occasions, be ready for the very intoxicated that are still there to entertain you as they (specifically the girls) bumble, stumble and possibly even make out in front of you. All in all, it's a fun place to be when you're looking for a night out on the town with the guys and gals!",0.002985486"My overall experience here was mediocre. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table for two, even though we got there at 4:30 on a Sunday, I was definitely HUNGRY and ready to eat what I thought was going to be the most delicious ramen EVER. However, when I left, I was tempted to just tell everyone in that ludicrously long line that the food simply was not worth it.Let's start with the good. The noodles are chewy, a little salty (in a good way), and have that fun yellow and wavy look (unlike the straight white noodles you find at Ippudo). Another nice surprise was that the broth is made from chicken, so it is lighter and less greasy than pork based broths. I still prefer pork based broth, but Totto's advantage is that it was rich and tasty without being overwhelming and making you feel a little sickly afterward. Lastly, the miso ramen ($11) comes with a half boiled egg, which is my ultimate weakness...a little package of savory creamy heaven!Now, on to the not-so-great. First, I ordered the pork topping (the alternative is chicken), which ended up being two small pieces of rubbery pork. They use very lean meat, which they proceed to overcook... Ick! Second, most of the ramen varieties come with only bean sprouts, meat, scallions, and an egg if you're lucky. You have to pay extra for toppings, even the simple ones like nori and corn will set you back an additional dollar per add-on, which I think is kind of tacky. Third, the wait is absolutely egregious. I cannot believe that even showing up as early as 4:30pm did not save me from a 45-minute wait. Side note: I also saw a waiter chase down a customer who he thought did not tip enough... Last time I checked, this is a free country, tips are a gratuity not a right, and you get them when you provide good service.The food was good (by ""good"" I mean 'above average', but not 'great') but the restaurant's too-cool-for-school attitude is so incredibly annoying. The ramen is 100% NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Go somewhere else, otherwise you'll leave Totto kicking yourself, wondering why you just let yourself waste an hour of your life waiting to get a bowl of ""above average"" ramen.",0.028501387Terri I cant deny is good.

The poor animals chained by the neck with heavy chains and locks looking sickly and sad crammed in a box where they cannot lay down if they chose to. One of the little girls in my son's class began crying when yet another cow barely had the strength to eat it's hay and she wanted us to unchain it and take it to the ""doctor."" The chickens in the coop are SICK!  One literally keeled over and died. A few moments later another keeled over!  I began screaming for my son to get the hell out of the coop as I saw other chickens were sick. The teachers then began screaming for their students to get out as well.

Glad I got to try it!!,0.095473316"Let&#39;s start out with the worst part....I ordered a spinach roll (along with other things), and paid online via credit card for said spinach roll. I didn&#39;t get said spinach roll, and when I called the restaurant back to ask where it was, they refused to pick up the phone. For a solid hour. And I know they were actively avoiding phone calls because every time I called there was a busy signal, meaning they took the phone off the hook, and the second I called when there was none, it would ring for a solid 10 minutes, and then immediately go back to busy signal. I don&#39;t understand how any business that wants to retain any sort of clientele would work in such a manner.I also realized shortly after this, that this Luigi&#39;s is owned by the same mediocre-to-awful Luigi&#39;s that I reviewed a week ago! Had I known, I never would&#39;ve ordered from here, knowing it would be an absolute complete waste of money.So let&#39;s get on with what else they did wrong... (shocker)...I ordered a caesar salad. It came with a handful of lettuce, bare minimum of dressing (coating the bottom of the aluminum dish it came with, and little else), and a few croutons. It tasted ok. Had it been substantial, I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying for it.I also ordered a penne ala vodka, which, although it tasted decent (3/5 stars), it had no Parmesan, and not the slightest hint of pepper - which it desperately needed. The aluminum tin was also 1/3 full. I think I could count the pieces of pasta we received. If you&#39;ve got some time on your hands, you can count them via the photo I uploaded. It was roughly 30. That&#39;s not worth what we paid for it.I ordered zeppoli, and instead of getting zeppoli, which are balls of dough deep fried, and completely covered in powdered sugar - instead I got tire-shaped pieces of dough (half the size of regular zeppoli), which not only aren&#39;t zeppoli, but are also covered in so little powdered sugar, that I could barely tell it existed in the first place. They were chewy (to the point of actually hurting your jaw), and tasted old and stale.I ordered beef patties, which were good, but how hard is it to re-heat Jamaican beef patties after they&#39;ve already been made for you?I so rarely give a place 1 star - I usually reserve it for restaurants where I literally get sick off the food. But this place was so dismissive, didn&#39;t care about their customers complaints (like paying for something online that was never delivered), and going so far as to take their phone off the hook to avoid answering it when a customer complains... Come on, that&#39;s just nonsense. And it&#39;s nonsense that no one should have to deal with.No thank you. I will most CERTAINLY be ordering from elsewhere, and advise that you do the same.Their ignoring of my phone calls is frustrating, and the longer they ignore, the longer my frustration grows, because you know what - when you mess up an order - especially one that a customer has already paid for - it&#39;s your responsibility as a conscientious restaurant - to make sure that customer gets said order - even if they order an hour before your closing time, and it takes you an hour to deliver it, leaving them less than a minute to call you back to complain about the order you messed up. And if it&#39;s an inconvenience to you to remain open for a few mins. longer when you&#39;ve messed up someone else&#39;s order, then that&#39;s something you should deal with. Now I&#39;M dealing with a messed up order until they re-open tomorrow at noon, and I&#39;ll be starving all night for them having forgotten my meal, (the rest of this order was my boyfriend&#39;s - thankfully I stole a bite of everything), and being too cocky to pick up the phone to remedy it. [Edit] - I&#39;m increasing their rating to 2 stars because they just agreed to deliver the spinach roll I didn&#39;t get yesterday. It tastes ok (3/5) but is about 25% smaller than your average spinach roll. They make the same mistake of their Ave. U Luigi&#39;s location of not chopping the spinach up first, so you take a bite, and the entire rolls contents drag out of the dough, and are gone. Wouldn&#39;t order again. Not impressed.",0.299966093"Unassuming little shop but HELL. YES. You walk in and literally all you can really see are sacks of potatoes on the shelves on the wall, fryers, and a lot of different sauces, which is how it should be!I always get the smallest size of fries. Trust me! I'm a girl and I feel stuffed after finishing that. The first time I came here my eyes were larger than my stomach so I got either a medium or a large and I felt sick afterwards. Full and happy, but sick from eating 3 pounds worth of potatoes. Fries are big and meaty and filling. Plenty greasy, but not swimming in a pool either, which made me happy. My standby sauces are the lemon dill, horseradish, parmesan pepper, and roasted garlic.My boyfriend swears by the mango chutney and won't get anything else, but it's just not my thing! To each his own!",0.156238537"We always try to find a good place that features 'burgers and fries/BAR food' as their go-to dishes for usually, we are always acquainted with our best meals at such places. So, after Comic Con this year, we thought it would be interesting to walk up to this restaurant and try it out once and for all.Environment 7/10: First off, it's a corner-of-the-block kind of place so it isn't hard to miss and the outdoor seating goes all around; always a nice touch and one that we took advantage of. The seating was surprisingly spacious enough for us two, as it sat for four, with all of our merch and bags from the convention. Depending on how you feel about the streets and people outside, you are fenced off but you still have the busy and noisy road right in front of you but like I said, depending how you are with noisy and loud surroundings with your meal, I say go inside but we were happy as is. The bathroom was amazingly clean and very spacious, with the sick being away from the toilet and 'relief utensils' as my uncle calls them so if you need to wash your hands, you can do that without holding up anyone who had finished their 'duty'.Service 6/10: The service was very good and I have very little to argue in this category with my review. We were seated within 5-7 minutes, considering how crowded and busy the restaurant was. The server was very frequent with our requests: taking our orders, refills, check, etc. They were professional and formal and made our time pleasant. One thing that had gotten on our nerves at one point was toward the end of out meal, we eventually asked for the bill. While the server went back inside to retrieve our tab, we waited almost ten minutes. Figured while awaiting his return, I made my way to find the bathrooms. While turning around to get up, I peered into the establishment and caught our server just leaning and hanging out by the bar, talking with a fellow employee as well as what seemed to be a customer whom he could have possibly knew, Im not sure.What ever the case was, I wasn't happy having to wait for them on my way out because they chose to take a few minutes to themselves and hold us up from our plans. I can only imagine how many more times this happened.Food Quality 6/10: Last but not least, the food. Merg had ordered a vegetarian dish, artichoke dip with cheddar tots, and I went with the buffalo chicken breast with fries aside from an order of beer pretzel sticks to split. My sandwich was without a doubt delicious as well as the fried that accompanied it but the sauce had been drizzled over it, rather than the sauce be all over the fillet. I can also assume that our waiter had struck up another conversation on the way to get our order because the sauce had gone a bit hard and slightly chilled instead of the intended hot. We both agree that the pretzel sticks were nice, crisp with a sweet and soft center. The downside was the dip; oily, runny, soggy and beyond garlicky for the mrs.; and that says a lot coming from a girl who kisses a guy who eats whole cloves of the stuff. Another element that bugged me was pricing. Now, I'm not saying that I didn't do my research on this place's affordability before I chose to attend it. But when I can order dishes at other places, one's that are cooked nicely as well as properly, and I can view other eateries literally right across the street from me when my eating experience isn't going so well, it truly does hurt my time spent at 5.N.B.Overall: We will admit we did enjoy my time here considering the company and also with just how much fun we had that day with the comic convention and all but when it came to finally settling down from being on our feet all day and just relaxing to some 'up-scale bar food', we were a bit disappointed. With our leisurely server taking their time, the food's pricing, as well as it reputation not matching its expected quality, we were let down but at least we were full. Def check it out on a day where it isn't as busy, especially not a Friday evening during a major social event like NYCC. It could have potential and come a time where Merg and I are in the neighborhood again and have no other food joint to check out, we just may give it another go",0.070894791"I remember a time when I stopped liking Xi'an food, and I was not sure why. It was either I thought the proportions were small or that it was not delicious enough.

I come to conclusion that I love my noodles to be thick rather than thin squiggly lines and that is exactly what Xi'an Famous Food provides. I love the amount of spice they add into, it is not too spicy and it is definitely not bland. On a really hungry day, I would add a beef bun as an appetizer, $3 and it is amazing. In addition, they have a bunch of cheap drinks in the fridge such as soy milk or tea, which is a great add if you cannot handle your spicyness. Xi'an Famous Food is a place I can go to 3-5 times a week and not get sick of it.

Was an unforgettable experience and worth the price for a once in a while treat. The one thing that really amazed me about this restaurant is its toro because everywhere else I've ever had it (other high end places such as nobu and morimoto) has made me sick but not here it is so fresh it's mind blowing.

The atmosphere brings out the customers friendly side.  The best French Onion soup I have ever tasted.  The menu is a great selection of Irish food, however; the food must not always be prepared by the same chef.  Sometimes the food is cooked to perfection and other times it's uneven and just not quite right.  Ex:  the tuna sandwich is usually one if my favorites that I like medium rare.  However last week it was rare in the middle and burnt on the outside.  Probably cooked under too high of heat. The hostess is cute ass hell, but isn't very friendly.

I like my burger pink and juicy, but lately when I order medium at other places, i get a half mushy burger, and i'm sick of it.I had to go back a 2nd time to order medium given the great overall reviews.  $26 for a burger and fries is still overpriced, but it's definitely one of the best burgers i've ever had.  The grilled onions have an excellent, somewhat sweet flavor.  Only complaint is that it was a bit salty overall.  Always a good sign when you don't need cheese to make a burger, though.The fries are standard crispy thin fries.  They give you a ton, so at the least, it's a filling meal.  I much prefer these to soggy steak fries.  Nothing special, though.If you don't want to wait, go late on a Sunday night (say 9 PM).  Had no trouble getting a table.  On any week night, you'll either wait around 45 min for a table, or have to settle for the cramped bar.  As others have said, they do take reservations.The service is decent, and they have a nice drink menu.

Few years ago, they had a ""sauce and veggie cart"" station where you can get as much green, orange, or red hot sauce as you want, along with some radishes, vegetables, jalapenos with your tacos. They took the cart away. Now, they bring the green and orange habinero hot sauce to you. The sauce gives it away.

The Chinese take out place across the street from there makes better chicken and it's half the price for x2 the quantity. I was a little irked that they didn't even offer a complimentary drink for serving my mother RAW chicken but hey, there needs to be improvement to the staff in customer service.Hopefully, they have some major improvements in the quality of food because this place will not be in business for long.",0.32367891"I tried ""the Duet noodle"",whichYou can choose 2toppings amongst 5or 6Options.I chose shrimp wonton and pork hog.And the volume was pretty big.Since they don't use MSG,I did notfeel sick when I finished it.The price was $7.75+tax.",0.103686457"The Spinach Artichoke Pizza is beyond amazing. It's not even funny how much I with they sold it by my house. Savory, Salty, Cheesy, it's delicious, and huge so be careful. Everytime I eat a slice i'm STUFFED to the point I get sick but it's so good I can't stop eating it!",0.059475096"This place is a dump.  While they are renovating they are trying to conduct business as usual.  Later at night they have workman sheet rocking and plastering right over your food, with minimal protection to the food stuff.  Last night a man was plastering a wall directly over the bakery items with barely a sheet of plastic covering the food items.  In another aisle, the entire floor was being drilled at in an effort to lift off the old tiles.  Dust and other debris was all over the place.  But forget the renovation... This store is always a dirty place.  And while I've been shopping here for years, I'm staring to get real concerned abou the safety of the food in this place.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Marie Calendar's pie for 10.00 and found when I took it home it was a mess - it obviously sat on a hand truck waiting to be unpacked and put in the freezer for quite some time.  I'm concerned about all the pre sliced (in store sliced) meats and cheeses in one of the coolers where the stuff looks like its been sitting a bit to long.  Everything in this store is a dirty mess.  I'm sick of shopping in dirt and so have decided not to go there anymore",0.230540065"decor: huge place with beautiful high wood slatted ceilings. tons of tvs with various games on, but no sound. wtf. let me repeat that. it's a sportsbar with a bazillion tvs, none of which have sound because listening to shitty top 40s music makes better sense. service: super slow. the waitress couldn't give two shits. it's like a slightly upgraded hooters but minus the 80s wigwam socks and $18 cocktails. the latter i guess because its right off park ave south. whatever. upside, the busboys were efficient and with quickness. thumbs up.food: just terrible. why do you ask how i'd like my burger if you're just going to ignore me? cardboard might taste better than my wagyu beef burger. only redeeming quality is their truffle mac 'n cheese; actually tasty. their hot and spicy margarita was neither. hot wings weren't half bad, but their hot = mild.two stars because i didn't get food poisoning. hooray!",0.311549733"They deserve every terrible review written. I am very sick and made an order of chicken noodle soup among other things.I tried to pay via credit card - they dont accept credit card via the phone. I had a hundred dollar bill - the woman said that would be fine & that the delivery man would bring change. He didnt bring change - gave me insane attitude when I said that I was not willing to let him leave with the money and bring it back later (Order was $17.)He stormed away with the food - I called the restaurant back & they did NOTHING.",0.094401236"King Noodle!!!! I have to send my compliments to the chef here. If you're sick of your old repertoire of cuisines, you've gotta go to King Noodle! Their menu is so unique, it's unlike any Asian style restaurant out there. I've been consistently impressed with every plate they have!! First, the kimchee carbonara was Perfect. A crazy unique combo of flavors, I've never had anything quite like this. The sauce was so tasty! The marinated beef skewers were the highlight of dinner, for me. The highlight of the last few dinners I've had! The steak is so tender, and the marinade- freaking delicious. I want more. Okay, the chili fries are also a MUST- I can't describe how good these are. We were scraping the plate at the end!! Not only their food, but the drinks were awesome too! The Grand mariner The scorpion bowl.. That's all I can say :) Bottom line: Funky asian fusion, done right.",0.132865584"Walk slow, because you might miss this placing.... I had a coconut fudge ice-cream, which was good. a lot of coconut if you are a coconut person. the real win here is the mocha ice-cream.  It actually tastes like a mocha without being sickly sweet. I would say if you love coffee, and if you love real coffee, then you should come and try the mocha ice-cream.",0.008020566"Aesthetically, I love it even more than the original Tao (uptown). Stadium seating gets me hot & bothered. Long, dark entrance-way is sick. Hostesses and waitresses are hot. Food was obviously expensive but worth it. I loved the mapo tofu noodles, which was authentic yet original. Bok Choy was even better than 5-star Asian-prepared. Great drinks, especially the Tao-tini. The atmosphere is unbeatable. It's busy but not crowded, even though there is a wait to be seated. Definitely make reservations in advance. The place is huge. It feels even bigger than the one uptown. The bar is in the back and much more secluded, which would make waiting much more endurable. The location is amazing, right in the heart of meatpacking. TAO has done it again. Would really love to come back here on a date.",0.016073954"One of my favorite bars in the Lower East Side, and I mean LOWER Lower East Side. I grew up around the area, just two blocks away, and I remember when it was just a local dive bar. Now it's got a New Orleans theme, even more divy-er, and the bathrooms are disgusting, but oh well, what bathrooms are clean in dive bars? I've had the dumplings once, it was just okay, I don't come to a dive bar for dumplings though, you can go across to Lam Zhou for the best dumplings in the city. I come here for super cheap ass drink specials, like $3 for a beer and shot during happy hour, and it's only goes up to $5 when it's not happy hour. There actually is a selection of cheap beer, like Miller High Life and PBR, and a selection of well liquor like whiskey, tequila and etc. There's also a selection of cider and good selection of drafts as well. I love the vibe and energy in the bar, even though 99% of the crowd isn't from NYC, I always have a good cheap time whenever I'm in the area. I'm hesitant to try the other foods, such as the raw oyster bar, cause the place looks kinda filthy, but then again, I've been eating in Chinatown all my life, so maybe I have a iron stomach by now. I'll update if I get food poisoning.",0.022210115
