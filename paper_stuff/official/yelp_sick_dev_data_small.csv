"My friends and I ordered 3 burgers and a pitcher of sangria. Everything tasted good. Later on in the day we all got a stomach ache then 1 by 1 we all had to use the restroom several times before the days end. I love this place, but something there made us sick. 

If I go back, I&#39;m going to stick with bottled beer.",1
"Went here yesterday with a friend.  We both got food poisoning, most likely from the cajun chicken. Resulted in a pretty rough night last night and for my friend, a rough day today (will spare the details, but you can imagine).

Would recommend steering clear unless you&#39;re looking to ruin about 24 hours of your life.

Good happy hour special though after the last 24 hours I&#39;d stick to bottled beverages, trust factor on anything prepared there is low.

As an aside, during a previous trip, we were required to order at our tables rather than the counter, this caused the length of our visit to nearly double since they were understaffed to offer waiter service.

Management needs to take a look in the mirror and re-evaluate quality and process.",1
"If I was writing this review for Choice Market one year ago, it would have been a solid 4 stars. Today, it pains me to have to leave a 1-star feedback for this Clinton Hill staple. 

I frequent Choice Market approximately once a week for lunch - usually have it delivered via Seamless or pick it up from there. While the service has always been abysmal, yesterday&#39;s Choice experience left me vowing never to return. 

My co-workers and I placed an order via Seamless for pickup. The first mark on them was that when we got there they alerted me that one of the items we had ordered was one they didn&#39;t have. I don&#39;t know why they couldn&#39;t be bothered to call and tell me that before they charged my card AND proceeded to make the rest of the order. I have ordered from other places who happened to have something on their menu that was not in stock and received a call to alert me of this every. single. time. Upon asking them, &#34;Well, what are my options?&#34; The guy rudely said &#34;Um. A refund?&#34; Well, as I mentioned, the refund never came and I had to call Seamless, who very quickly resolved the matter.

Now, as far as the food itself...it was off. My co-worker and I both ordered the steak panini and the steak in it tasted really REALLY off. We both noticed this and ended up removing the meat from the sandwich, but not until after we ate the first half of it. It tasted like old meat. I can&#39;t really describe it, but it was terrible. I always order the steak panini there and have never had this experience before. I also know how the sandwich and meat is supposed to taste. Well, as cliche as it may be, both of us ended up sick with severe stomach cramps from it!

I can&#39;t in good conscience ever order from here again. At least before, their food was actually worth the headache it is to have to deal with them. Now, its completely not. I know this place gets a lot of love because on the surface they seem super awesome and have lots of varieties of food and drinks, but its completely not worth it, anymore. Total fail.",1
"First, let me just say I have had El Rey numerous times. My order is always the same, a steak burrito and a chicken taco. On my recent visit, my girlfriend and I both got FOOD POISONING.  Both of us have been sick with the same exact symptoms for the past two days. I am not one to bash El Rey considering I love their food but considering my latest experience I am unsure if I will be a returning customer any more.",1
"Disappointment: the tapas taste quite well and are original. But they are so overpriced: around $15 per each tiny plate, with taxes. We paid $57 per person and were still so hungry! Moreover, at least three of my seven friends including me were sick after that dinner. It might have been the scallop. 

I found the decoration a bit weird, too loaded. And the references to Spain are difficult to grasp. 

Although the tapas are original, i dont think i will go again.",1
"I haven&#39;t been on yelp to write a review in a while, but I felt a need after my experience here.  

I had brunch here on Saturday and my fiance got food poisoning.  I would assume it was from the sangria that apepars to just sit out throughout brunch (and from some of the review below, although I cannot vouch for it, appears to sit in pretty unsanitary conditions) in teh hot sun.  

I would discourage anyone from going here unless they are interested in getting sick.",1
"I&#39;m French, and this is not French cuisine.  It&#39;s not even good cuisine.

Also, I got food poisoning from that place.  I was really upset and spoke with the manager (Alain) who was obnoxious about it.  I would never go back.  My god, there are so many much better and CLEANER places in Manhattan.",1
"My scallops tasted delicious, but they gave me food poisoning! :( 
Also, I thought the arroz de pato was just OK.",1
"this is the response I got from them after 4 days and 2 emails.......they called me and my family LIARS..........

"Worst. Food poisoning. Ever.

Now, I&#39;ve eaten at M Noodle several times without an issue, mainly because they stay open really late. But after this most recent trip I&#39;m never going back. I know I was sick from the dumplings I ate here and not from something else, because 1) I ate/drank nothing for 12 hours prior 2) I felt a little &#34;off&#34; right after I ate them, then 2-3 hours later... BAM! I see I&#39;m not the first Yelp user to report getting sick here, so if you too are thinking of heeding the siren song of late-night dumplings, just make yourself a bowl of cereal instead. It&#39;s not worth it.",1
"Staff is super friendly and I love that a sandwich place of this calibre has finally opened in the neighbourhood.

Unfortunately, I think I got crazy food poisoning from my last burger from here (only thing I had all day and then some for three days...). Hopefully it was a fluke cause I really like this place.

Props on the excellent fries as well.",1
I ordered a combo meal and received food poisoning. I actually vomited my food... But not before I suffered severe stomach pains! Please do not eat in an establishment that serves expired or unclean food.,1
"As a fixture here for many years it breaks my heart to write this review but to warn off my fellow yelpers I must. 

I ordered the chicken cacciatore and the chicken parm and both seemed a bitt off. The chicken cacciatore came out and the chicken was hard and un-chewable.The chicken parm was above average but tuned out to be a disaster as well.  We told our waitress who was incredibly nice and she sent it back immediately to the chef. He brought out another dish of the cacciatore but the damage was done. He admitted the chicken was not right. It turned out that I was food poisoned. I am vomiting my guts out as we speak. 

To make matters worse I gave the restaurant a courtesy call and the lady on the phone was rude and gave me the most insincere sarcastic apology in the history of apologies. 

Lennys as a fixture here for many years since the days the qzar was right next door I am afraid to say I will no longer dine in your restaurant. When you pay 13-16 dollars for a dish I do not expect to have chicken that was too hard to chew and frozen or something that will make you sick .",1
"I ate here once, this past week and got FOOD POISONING. I was here with my date, we ordered the Duck Chicharones, Merguez, Duck Cigars, Steak Frites and the culprit - the Duck Liver Moose. My date and I shared everything except the Duck Liver Moose, and I ended up being sick all that night and the follow day. I should have trusted my instincts when the dish seemed less like a liver moose, and more like cream cheese in texture. 

I called the restaurant, twice, to speak to the General Manager and never got a call back.

I will NOT be eating here again.

UPDATE:

The GM did reach out to me and offered me a giftcard in the mail. I still don&#39;t think I&#39;d eat here again, after being traumatized by the first experience. I appreciate the follow up, though!",1
This is one of the worst fast food place to stop and catch a bite. I got food poisoning from eating there twice. Ended up in emergency for 7hrs vomiting sharp pain amongst other things that was happening. I&#39;m so sorry I ate there.,1
"As its just around the corner we frequently order from here. Sushi is usually badly rolled and always falling apart, but I am not fussy when just killing off some hunger in a hurry. However husband usually likes getting the chicken.... until today.... FOOD POISONING. :(    So yeah, we will no longer eat from here.",1
I ordered French toast and got terrible food poisoning. I was puking for several days. it sucked. &#34;Coffee Friends&#34; are no friends of mine.,1
"Waiters were invisible....they dissapeared for 20mins since they brought my check. So I ended up going to the inside counter to pay.
Also!!!!! after finishing dinner, I contracted food poisoning. Now I am in the emergency room and keep throwing up. What a good dinner!!",1
Food poisoning from a soy milk frapuccino! Avoid this place!!!,1
"FOOD POISONING!!!!

As another yelper mentioned, these guys [which one of the managers admitted to me]  have a problem with product freshness.  If I had only known before I spent an entire day VIOLENTLY ILL and the two days following at home too weak to go out.

when I was finally able to sit upright and speak I called Juice Press to let them know there was a &#34;problem&#34; with their product in the hopes of protecting other people.  I was passed from &#34;manager&#34; to &#34;manager&#34;...........I was offered free food coupons for the Juice Press [as if....] and then to other restaurants [which I did not accept.} 
By the level of anger from the various employees I spoke to [both on the telephone and then later in person], they have heard this complaint before.

Shout out to Shom for not even taking the time to call the next day to see how I was feeling, or for crediting my charge card for the smoothie as promised.

Negative stars if I could, but you have to give one or you can&#39;t post",1
"Okay, so usually I don&#39;t like being harsh on reviews, nor do I like making reviews solely based on a one-time experience, but I feel that it&#39;s appropriate to lash out right now.

I&#39;ve gone to this restaurant multiple times in the past. I remember it being a good experience as a child, so I decided to revisit the restaurant again as a teenager. But from what I recall, that experience was terrible. I ordered the only thing most people order from here, and that&#39;s the pork chop over rice. The dish was too salty and it almost tasted as if the pork may have been a bit past it&#39;s expiration date--rotten to say the least. I recall not finishing my dish at all.

Fast forward a couple years ahead, to last night and here we have another problem. Ever since that bad experience I had with the restaurant, I never wanted to go back. However, my boyfriend seems to enjoy the pork chop over rice so we came back for a late night bite. I didn&#39;t want to eat, so he and his friend both ordered.

From what he told me, the pork was too salty, and he wasn&#39;t much of a tea drinker so we asked for a glass of water to wash down the food. While they were busy talking, I watched as the waiter grabbed a cup and scooped up ice from a dirty white commercial bucket that was sitting on the floor next to the sink to serve water with. I&#39;ve never worked at a restaurant, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not where ice should be taken from.

At this point, I should&#39;ve mentioned something, but I didn&#39;t which I terribly regret. Because hours later, we get home, go to sleep, and not even an hour into my sleep cycle, I hear my boyfriend get out of bed to grab the garbage can from under my table. I turn around and wake up to the sight of him vomiting into the trash can in deep pain. I was confused because he had only had two beers that night, and he definitely does not vomit off two beers.

He had cold sweats, his stomach was in pain and his body was unsettled. By this point, I knew he had gotten food poisoning. He spent the rest of the night vomiting and dry heaving, as if his body was attempting to regurgitate and remove something that would not leave his body. He was constantly running back and forth between the bedroom and the bathroom due to liquid bowels/watery stool that he was barely able to control. These are all severe symptoms of food poisoning.

He spent all of the next day sleeping in attempt to regain energy but his body was still extremely weak after resting for most of the day. This led me to call 311 to report the restaurant and call the poison center where I was informed that if these symptoms do continue, he&#39;d have to go to the hospital, which we both don&#39;t want to have to deal with.

I always thought this restaurant was disgusting, but I haven&#39;t felt the need to make a negative review on it until now. I never understood how people even liked the food at this restaurant. The food is nothing special, if not terrible, and the service is lacking--but that goes for most Chinese restaurants in Flushing.

Moral of the story, don&#39;t eat here unless you want to risk getting food poisoning and feeling like you&#39;re five steps closer to death.",1
Stopped off here before jumping on the path one night.  I got food poisoning and it was the most painful path ride home ever.  I will not be coming back here again.,1
"This is my first review. I normally would never post, but felt compelled to due to the bad experience I had compared to the 4 star reviews this place keeps getting. I am not sure what the hype is all about.

I went to White Bear and got #6 because of the rave reviews on Yelp. Not only did the wontons not live up to the hype, it gave me food poisoning (yep, lovely vomiting and diarrhea for at least an hour). Sorry, if TMI.

Health issues aside, the dumplings were mediocre at best. The meat filling to dough ratio was paltry. Too much doughy wrapping for the small amount of meat. The spicy oil as some have suggested is not really spicy at all. I have had much better homemade wontons. 

Maybe I got a bad batch, but I won&#39;t be going back to try my luck again.",1
"I have lived in Queens for many years and I been to this diner a handful of times.  They always have mediocre food and service.  But the last time I was here was awful!  I went there with my husband for breakfast.  The waitress was really weird.  When she came over to the table to ask us if we were ready to order, we said we needed a little more time.  She said, &#34; ok. I don&#39;t want you to get mad and say I&#39;m ignoring you.&#34;  when we did give her our order, she asked my husband if he wanted juice and he said he only wanted water for now. She said, &#34;ok ok I&#39;m just asking.&#34; she was asking like we were yelling at her.  We thought we were on a hidden camera show.  When my husband asked for beef sausage, she chuckled and said no beef sausages.  At the end of breakfast when she came over to ask if everything was ok, she noticed I didn&#39;t drink my oj and she scolded me.  But worst of all and the reason I will never go there again and the reason I&#39;m writing this on yelp, which I will say is the first review I have ever written, is what happened after I left.  I was so sick from the food I ate there, I missed two days of work.  The only other place I went for the next two days was my bathroom!  Maybe I&#39;m an easygoing person so I could deal with a bipolar waitress, it was actually funny as I told the story to my friends, but I can&#39;t deal with crying from pain as I&#39;m sitting on the toilet.",1
"I don&#39;t even know where to start...

When I first saw the restaurant I thought it was a mirage, given that it suddenly appears from nowhere and once you look inside it seams like a magical place. But little you know, as soon as you enter, the magic is gone and you go down Dante&#39;s food inferno! 

The service: They act  like they are doing you a favor by noticing you, and when they actually talk to you suddenly you are not smart enough for them and they should not waist their time on you. Extremely condescending would be the best way to describe it, with a touch of evilness and I can&#39;t be bothered to waits my time with you tome of voice and attitude. 

The food: Let&#39;s just say that the word mirage would describe it, everything &#34;looked delicious&#34; but it tasted awful!.  First, the bread looked delicious, but once you had your first bite it felt as if you just put in your mouth a five day old bread... hard as a rock and stale as a card box! The carpaccio, it looked like a modernist painting with touches of  vibrant colors, but it tasted like flavorless thin slices of meet with salt. Talking about salt... their bread with tomato, it was basically stale bread with salt and touches of tomato. In essence, I knew that my stomach was going to pay for this mirage... and was not wrong... I was sick for almost two days after I tried to eat there. I want to emphasize the tried,  because my friend and I, had to send everything back after the first bite. 

In short, don&#39;t go there... its not good a place!",1
I had the worst food poisoning after eating there this weekend. It even cost me a trip to the ER,1
The food was delicious. What wasn&#39;t delicious is the food poisoning I got as a result. I ate there Saturday night. It&#39;s Monday now and I&#39;m still sick as a dog. First time in my life I ever got food poisoning and it is miserable. I will never walk into that place again.,1
"Three words to describe this place... Food poisoning sucks! (Apologies to Val S.)

My experience while I was there was good. Seated promptly (Nargis had a 40 minute wait), the food didn&#39;t take long, it was hot and tasty, the servers were nice and attentive. I asked for water to drink and got charged $2.50 for a little bottle of Poland Spring instead of most places&#39; free water, and got the 10% &#34;service fee&#34; another review mentioned, both apparently common in Russia, so I accordingly left a smaller tip than I&#39;d normally give (which is high for American standards, and very high for western European standards &amp; I assume Russian standards too).

My experience after I left there took a clear turn for the worse. About 30-45 minutes after eating, I felt a sharp pain in my gut, but it didn&#39;t last long, so I didn&#39;t think much of it. Another hour after that, I was speeding home to get to my bathroom as quick as possible, and spent a good deal of time there in the day that followed. I had the manti, ground lamb kebab, and rice, with sour cream &amp; some tomato-based sauce. Nothing seemed suspect at the time, but it sure did later.

Were it not for the food poisoning, I&#39;d give them 4*. I hate to give them such a low rating since things started off so well, but sorry, food poisoning automatically bottoms it out.",1
"VERY BAD SERVICE. AND FOOD IS BLAH!

I went there with my wife it took them about 10 minute to greet and and seat us.
after we placed our order they forgot to prepare my wife&#39;s order their excuse was they are busy but from what I saw the waiters were to busy texting and talking with one another. 

after all their food is horrible got sick after eating there I will recommend my enemy to eat here.",1
Zero stars.    I have food poisoning and just made it thru the broadway play before it kicked in.    Never to return to HARU.    Thx much for the memories but you should get a new rating from the board of health or be shut down.,1
"Seriously, $8-$9 for a 25cl glass of beer??? People, that is 8.4 ounces which means a pint would cost 16-18 dollars. I used to visit this place all the time many years ago and would meetup with friends. It appears the owners have changed. I&#39;ve had the mussels and frites before and got sick and threw up later that evening, I think from the mussels - frites by themselves are fine though, just a bit greasy. The place is beat down inside, chairs are all assorted folding chairs near the front with some wooden tables and chairs in the midle and back. It&#39;s dimly lit but even looking beat down inside has a nice laid back dive bar vibe to it. I just can&#39;t get over their prices, I mean they have just gone insane. You get a beer and half the thing or more is foam. I don&#39;t recall that years ago and every glass back than was 33cl. I casually mentioned the abundance of foam to the asian girl serving me the drink and she told me it&#39;s &#34;Belgian Style&#34;. I know how Belgians serve the beer and yes I know they pour a big head, but my glass had both the 25cl line and the 33cl line printed on it so why couldn&#39;t they pour it to 33cl for $9?? Sorry, but that&#39;s just too much a a rip off IMO and they are taking advantage of young trendy people that don&#39;t know any better, or care.",1
"I think we went on an off day but my boyfriend and I ended up with a mild case of food poisoning. Our group ordered the hamachi appetizer (which tasted unusually fishy), grilled calamari appetizer, the spaghetti bolognese,  panko crusted chicken entree and a few other dishes. The only acceptable dish was the chicken. I&#39;m just glad that I didn&#39;t order the uni given that our of any raw seafood, that&#39;s the first to go bad. 

Such a disappointment after such anticipation. Next time I crave Japanese Italian food, I&#39;m going back to Greenwich Grill.",1
I got food poisoning!!!  I ordered a custom salad with grilled shrimp and was throwing up (and other things) 2 hours after I finished my lunch.  Never order or eat here....disgusting!!!,1
"I always enjoyed a meal at The Islands. Their jerk chicken was always a favorite of mine. Alas me and them ways have parted thus this one time favorite of mine has been regulated to 2 stars. 

What happened you may ask. Well I want you to imagine the fifth gate of hell, no not the post office, but the actual fifth gate of hell. Swimming with demons, monsters, all of which are set on wrecking havoc. That&#39;s what my insides were like after a recent trip there. Food poisoning or whatever, my body was out of commission for several days. For that I can&#39;t recommend this place to anyone anymore and I don&#39;t know if I dare step back inside. 

It&#39;s a shame because the food was always pretty solid. Except their Mac and Cheese. That wasn&#39;t ever anything special.",1
Ive never complained about the food until one time when my entire family actually got food poisoning from this place! and atop of that the delivery man got nasty with me because I paid him in a dollar coin since I was told on the phone a different price so I didn&#39;t have in dollars the amount that he requested. Im extremely disappointed in this place. NEVER AGAIN.,1
It took me a long time to figure this place out-- but their dirt cheap prices are a result of procuring fruits and vegetables with the highest concentration of chemicals and pesticides I&#39;ve ever had. Every time I eat something from here I get sick. It&#39;s really blatant of them to sell this garbage produce.,1
"I had a juice from here for dinner last night and was the recipient of violent food poisoning five hours later. Since the restaurant uses similar facilities for their meats as for their fruits/vegetables that are not cooked and instead freshly pressed into juices, I am almost certain I received the poisoning from cross contamination. You may NO",1
"So....I got food poisoning here. I know a lot of people say that, and then follow up by saying &#34;well I mean, I think it was from here. I also had xyz before and after but...I THINK it&#39;s from here.&#34; Well, mine was definitely from TC. Because that&#39;s all I had eaten in the last 12 hours.

HOWEVER, the food was so damn good that I&#39;m still giving it a good review. I mean, you have to think that almost all restaurants are going to get someone sick at some point. And the odds are it probably won&#39;t be you!

The atmosphere was great, though the servers left something to be desired. I had a delicious eggplant and lamb dish. The portions are huuuuge.",1
Hostess was rude. Service was slow. Girlfriend got violent food poisoning.,1
"When&#39;s there for the Sunday brunch..I ordered the burger on an English muffin. The burger was ok, I have had better at five guys and bare burger.  Waitress asked if wanted cheese and bacon and I said sure.   After getting the bill I was charged $2.00 for a slice of cheese and get this $3.00  for one slice of bacon.   Oh and not to mention the next day I had diarrhea.",1
"Staff is nice, but order food and expect to get something more than what you ordered.... Namely, food poisoning. I ordered the simplest thing on the menu (chicken quesadilla) and 2 hours later... Poisoned... And no its not from anything else because this is all I&#39;ve had to eat in the last 12 hours. Thanks Cancun! Feel like I just went there and drank the water... Overall horrible experience.",1
"First this place gives you A TON of food, a fish sandwich is enough for two people.  Also it isn&#39;t even really a sandwich it&#39;s just two pieces of bread with like 8 pieces of giant fried fish put in between, so when it comes to quantity they sure are not lacking.

Problems arise when it comes to the fish its self, I mean it&#39;s pretty good, but the way they fry it I almost always find myself feeling kind of sick after gorging on fish here.  Maybe it&#39;s just that I eat to much of the damn fish, but, I don&#39;t think so.  Also the line to order is often long then the wait after can be over 20 minutes.  One thing I really love here is the fried clams, I find them to be much tastier than their fish...but once again a problem...they are always out often.

Great place to try, a real judgement call, but sure not the best fried fish I have ever had, the sides are nothing to write home about either.

They do have a letter from Obama to them though which is pretty cool I guess.  Also what in the world is up with the guy dressed in fatigues with a camera who sits outside all day everyday?",1
"I don&#39;t normally do this, but I&#39;ve gotten sick repeatedly from this place. I didn&#39;t want to admit it to myself, because this is by far the best brunch deal in town. To be fair, I have a weakened immune system, so I have to be very careful when I eat out. I used to come every weekend and, during that time and for a while thereafter, I would get stomach aches later in the day and throughout the week. I got sick all the time for a whole until I stopped eating here. Some things I noticed were: they keep a bleach rag for wiping down tables above their cocktail mixes, wait staff don&#39;t wash their hands in between cleaning tables and serving patrons, I have witnessed wait staff handle a mop by its fibers then immediately serve people (with their thumb on the top of the plate) without washing their hands in between.... Admittedly, I look out for these things because I get sick so easily but it&#39;s still no excuse for not being sanitary, especially considering how sick I&#39;ve gotten. I had to get antibiotics from a physician. 

This is definitely a great place if you have an iron stomach. But, if you&#39;re like me and have a weak stomach, I&#39;d steer clear.",1
Got a coke and a pepperoni slice with a side of food poisoning. I&#39;ve been in and out of the bathroom since 30 minutes after leaving. F Koronet Pizza!,1
"I purchased a groupon for 4 for dinner and it was the worst experience of my life, the food was horrendous. We had to send multiple things back the seafood was undercooked, the baked clams were salty and full of water. The entrees came my husbands fra diavalo sauce was brown and full of green peppers, the chicken parm was burnt and my pork chop stuffed with prosciutto were actually stuffed with a cheap ham steak or whatever but prosciutto it is not and chop was raw. My husband got a replacement  of veal marsala which is what my daughter ordered when that came out they were two totally different looking dishes. We didn&#39;t even stay for desert and almost everything went in the trash. I was sick for most of the evening so the few bites i did have had a terrible effect on my system. DO NOT GO!!!!",1
"This place is precious. Great for tea. Great for vegan items. Not sure about anything else...went there for a quick dinner last night. Got a burger, ordered it medium, and fries. The burger came super well done. And to top it all off, I&#39;ve been vomiting all day today. Maybe not the best place to take your kids...",1
"I went here with 4 friends before a show and was disappointed. The menu was very limited. The appetizers were decent, but nothing to write home about (calamari, shrimp). Everyone agreed that the entrees were meh - not inedible, but definitely below average. I had the fava bean tortolloni, which was decent at the first bite, but felt too heavy and butter-drenched by the third bite. The waiter forgot the side dish of broccolini I had ordered and brought it out promptly when reminded, but it was very hard and not seasoned much at all. I tried a friend&#39;s chicken saltimbocca, which was bland. The proscuitto in it was too tough and the chicken itself too thick. Another friend ordered a pasta dish and spent much of the night sick to his stomach. The whole experience was very disappointing given the plethora of options available in the area. Definitely skip this one.",1
"service was ok at first but when the entire party arrived and we didn&#39;t mean their expectations in the quantity ordered it was hard to get water refilled.  they rushed us out actually though there were vacant tables.

and it&#39;s not because of this rudeness i am mentioning this but i got food poisoning on the spot while eating here.  felt dizzy and dry mouth and i needed that water so i got up and walked up to a woman to ask for some.",1
"I got food poison from this location and I will never go back. This was my second time going so I had no reservations but a couple hours later when I found myself throwing up in the train station on 145th street in Harlem, I knew exactly where it come from. I got the baby spare ribs w/broccoli with brown rice. My food tasted delicious but it was not worth the two days of sickness that followed. And I know that it was from this restaurant because it was almost the only thing that I ate all day.  I will NEVER eat here again and I warn all others to be cautious.",1
"Straight up rude staffs. General manager Kerry is the big pain.
My friends got sick after eating oysters here.
There are many 1$ oyster places in the city where the service is the top of the line and the hygiene is the best- http://leshalles.net/

Just don&#39;t go here if you don&#39;t want to be mistreated. Such a bad experience every time I went. ( 3times just because my friends invited me)
I will never go back and want to save Yelp-er from horrible service.",1
"This diner once WAS my favorite place on Staten Island, until I called with a problem of food poisoning.  My guest became very sick after eating a menu item that the others in our party did not eat. 

When I called, I was treated poorly.  The manager (?) who finally accepted my call had an attitude, as as if it were not his concern.  I feel that their lack of concern over a customer&#39;s health shows a major lack of care which is inexcusable.

I wasn&#39;t looking for a free meal or a comp, I just wanted to bring to their attention that the food item was not fresh, so that it could be replaced.

I had nothing but good eat in service before this, but now I&#39;d never patronize them again. My health and my guests&#39; health is worth more to me.",1
"all i&#39;m gonna say is that im never ever coming back to this horrid place again...-__-
i&#39;ve always wanted to try outbacks for awhile, and i finally did this sunday, and i got food poisoning 6 hours later. i know i got food poisoning there because i didn&#39;t eat anything after outbacks. i had the chicken burger WHICH MAY I ADD WAS SO NOT WORTH THE PRICE. it looked unappetizing the moment i got it, and i ordered a side salad, blue cheese pecan if i recall, and it had way too much dressing. i&#39;m still suffering from food poisoning as i type this, i have vomited and feel nauseous. and i NEVER throw up. the service was very nice though, which is the only plus to this terrible place.",1
"Ordered delivery yesterday.  Got food poisoning.  Im sure it was isolated, but rest assured not eating here again!",1
"The guy who worked in the front hooked us up with a table. Came in at 7:00 and was immediately seated because someone canceled their reservations. That was a plus.

Our waitress was a little too overly attentive.She asked us if our food was okay at least twice for EACH plate of food we received. I&#39;m sure her intentions were good but it can get quite annoying. We ordered the scallops, oysters, clams,crab cakes and the clams fettuccine. The food tasted good, especially the scallops.

Now, up to this point, Upstate would probably still receive 4 stars. However my bf caught food poisoning from the food. He spent the entire weekend sick and had to take off work on Monday.  We&#39;re thinking it might be either the raw clams or the raw oysters.  I remember eating the clams and it had sand inside of it. Perhaps, it was not properly cleaned.",1
"We went there for a late night bite. The live jazz music was the only awesome thing of this place. We had the scallops (way overcooked) on a beurre blanc risotto (meh...) for $32 and a side of creamy spinach (the side was ok) for $7. We shared the cheesecake for dessert and it was good (but I was glad I had asked for the whipped cream on the side because it was definitely not homemade). We had 2 draft beers each and oh my god these were the most expensive Newcastle I had in a long time! The service was ok but we could tell the servers didn&#39;t really care... at all. 
We ended up paying way too much money for the quality of it and I woke up really sick in the middle of the night. 
We are definitely not going back to this place.",1
"1 star only because I cannot give 0.
I have two words for this place FOOD POISONING!
Steer clear of Chopt on 56th Street! Total garbage.",1
DON&#39;T DARE TRY THE LOBSTER DIP!   My boyfriend got so sick after he ate it.  Wi never return!!!,1
"FOOD POISONING TWICE!!

The first time was a couple months ago and I got it.  Last night I was with two friends staring at a plate of tacos and quesadillas and I said, &#34;I got food poisoning from this stuff, might want to be careful&#34; and chose not to eat the tacos because of it.

Fast forward five hours and my friend will be spending the rest of the day crawling back and forth to the bathroom.

This truck would be great if only it didn&#39;t make you so sick that you want to kill yourself.   Otherwise it&#39;s a good spot, but they get one star for letting this continue to happen.  Get your S**t straight food truck",1
My husband has never had food poisoning in his life until we ate at Hooters in NYC. He had a chicken burger and within half an hour was very sick for the rest of the day so it has put a negative perspective on this &#34;famous&#34; restaurant/bar.  We think the chef&#39;s have to be more careful with undercooking certain meats and to make sure they wash there hands after touching any raw foods. Was quite a scary experience today as it&#39;s the first time he has ever had food poisoning. I won&#39;t be recommending this place to anyone for the food.,1
"The best view of the NYC skyline. Nothing short. You just gotta see it. Made a mental note to take my cousin here the next time she visits the states.

Service was great. We had a table next to the window and they even rolled down the curtains for us when we asked politely (my boyfriend is sunlight-phobic and turned me into one too). The guy came back when the sun was setting so that we could admire the view. The waiter was pleasantly attentive and the spicy tuna and tobiko appetizer he recommended was on point--the best thing we had that night. We should&#39;ve asked him for his opinions on the entrees because I was quite disappointed.

We got the Sushi &amp; Sashimi for Two and I really wish we hadn&#39;t. Maybe ordering sushi here just wasn&#39;t appropriate, but it was just so severely ...meh? I&#39;ve had better from my local hole-in-the-wall sushi joint. Also... BEWARE... I&#39;m no expert on this matter, but I can tell a fresh fish from a not-so-fresh fish. My assumptions were confirmed later that night when I rolling around in bed sick to my stomach. 

We got the Sake Infused Chilean Seabass which was just mediocre. Though perfectly cooked, it lacked any unique flavor or dimension. 

I liked the molten lava cake dessert, but I&#39;d choose the one from Applebee&#39;s over Shi&#39;s. Then again--I&#39;d choose that Triple Chocolate Meltdown over ANYTHING. Judge me all you want. I ddddoonnttt caaare.

MAAAYBE I&#39;ll give this place another try and take the beaten path with the entrees. I really do want to like this place. Or maybe I&#39;ll just pack a picnic basket and enjoy the view from outside.",1
Dunkalicious! Also I got food poisoning.,1
"STAY AWAY:
1. Food poisoning
2. Terrible customer service at counter an on the phone when I called to notify about food poisoning
3. Aggressive supervisor told me I got sick because I took the wrong drink from the counter - despite the fact that the guy who made my juice told me it was a Coco Acai (my drink order!)",1
"Avoid this place! We bought a Groupon for this place, only because it had such wonderful reviews. Boy were we disappointed!

We made a reservation for Father&#39;s Day, thinking it would be a nice place to take our dads. When we showed up, the host looks at his watch, says in a loud voice &#34;You&#39;re really late--you should&#39;ve called&#34; and walks away! Needless to say, that&#39;s not the way to greet a customer! Furthermore, the restaurant was practically empty, except for a handful of tables. Nevertheless, we figured we came this far, so just give it a try...

Bad idea. We waited for about 40 minutes before the food came. And like I said, the place was practically empty. My husband and I both ordered sushi and sashimi, clams and oysters. That night, he came down with food poisoning!! We will never be going back to this place!",1
"Had a dinner 2 weeks ago and ended up having diarrhea and threw up in the middle of the night. I did not eat oysters or clams, I only had salmon sashimi (yeah, and from that I got diarrhea??? unbelievable!) I didn&#39;t even want to give a star if it wasn&#39;t for the waitress. Have to be honest, she was very attentive and friendly. She&#39;s the only thing good about this nori nori. But will I go back just for her? HELL NO!

ps I should discover The Buffet in College Point back then, that will save me from all these &#39;cleansing&#39; from my colons....",1
"The first time I went to Bon Juk was 10 yrs ago. I was visiting Korea, ate some street food, and had gastroenteritis x 1 week. I went to the hospital, got a shot in the buttock, and ate Bon Juk to nurse me back to health.

Last month, I had my second bout of gastroenteritis. I went to the hospital, got IV fluids, medications to keep food down and up... Went to Bon Juk and the abalone juk once again nursed me back to health.

Cooked to order, al dente, smooth, luxurious juk. I then visited my mother who made me a huge vat of juk which I ate for the rest of the week. Nothing beats empty calories of white rice when you&#39;re sick.",1
"It was hard to figure out what to review this place. I really, really like the food. I&#39;m a vegetarian so I appreciate that I can eat everything here: it&#39;s all vegan. However, I&#39;ve been here 3 times, and 2 of those times I got violent food poisoning. The second time I wasn&#39;t even sure I was going to make it home before things got ugly.

I got General Tsao&#39;s soy protein the first time, which was super delicious but...sick. The second time, I got stir-fried vegetables and tofu and brown sauce and again, very delicious but...food poisoning! You&#39;d think I would stay away but my friends love this place... so the third time I went I ordered a salad, which did not give me food poisioning. Yay.

Maybe one day I will try it again and not get sick, but maybe if you have a weak stomach, you should venture elsewhere.",1
"I&#39;m sure that either these reviews are fake or have been written by nit wits who can&#39;t tell the difference between good food and the asshole they use the same fingers to clean it as they typed the glowing reviews of this dump that sells twenty dollar, circular, used maxi pads shat out of dead elephant&#39;s pussy. This place sucks at making food. The first time I went by I was totally drunk, got wings, threw it up and spent a day with severe food poisoning and figured it was my fault for partying. Second round though I am as sober as a judge and these guys did me dirty. They sold me two different frozen pizzas sewn together in two different boxes so poorly cooked that the pepperoni was STILL FROZEN when I bit into the &#34;fresh pie&#34; that I waited for them to bake. I wouldn&#39;t even post this unless I had no intention of ever going back, seeing as how I just threw $20 in the garbage because it&#39;s anthrax. I&#39;ll just give everyone with common sense a red flag so they know that it&#39;s smarter to hunt rats than to eat the baked bread they shit in.",1
"I will NEVER eat at Sophie&#39;s again... maybe it&#39;s just this &#34;New Street&#34; location.. but the past month or so.. I&#39;ve gotten food poisoning from this location.  

Had the Oxtail platter - got really sick... was not pretty
Had the Chicken platter (it&#39;s a special on Tuesday &amp; Thursday only) - same sick feeling combine with total vomitting... not a good look at work...!! Arggh... 

I am so over it; this place needs to be cleaned up.  

I have never gotten sick from the Chamber Street location or the one in midtown.  
Totally skipping from now on.  Tsk Tsk",1
"Went here in Summer of 2012 when the place first opened. The food was below par. I do give the owner efforts for offering us a free desert, but again it was below par. My bf got the squid pasta, and actually got food poisoning here....Pretty sure it was from here, because it hit him about an hour after dinner and he didn&#39;t eat anything else. Really because of this incident, it has scared us away from going back",1
This review is related to the 110 St location. Came here after a morning of tennis. My GF had chicken salad i had the barbacao bowl. Within an hour we both had a tummy ache then followed by diarrhea. Sent Chipotle an email have yet to hear back. Never thought a place like this would not have thought through hygene issues. Maybe i&#39;m unlucky but i cant afford the pain.,1
"We went to Craft this past Father&#39;s day.  over the past few years, this was our 3rd time at this restaurant.  Our other visits were perfectly fine.  We were expecting the same.  After a meal that met our expectations, we departed, not expecting the horror that was to follow.  3 our of 4 of the people at our table had food poisoning shortly afterwards.  Horrible.  We think it was either the sea scallops or the butter lettuce with six minute egg.  After a rough night when I emerged a few lbs lighter (so all was not entirely lost, i suppose...)    I called the restaurant in the AM.  It was evident that Erica  (reception) Megan and Justin (general managers) were less than concerned about our experience.   For this reason, I am giving them a thumbs down and warning folks to beware the seafood, especially on a Sunday!  Thankfully, NYC has no shortage of fabulous restaurants, no need to give this one your business....",1
"Great breakfast. An egg w/bacon on a croissant there? Amazing. Bagels are tasty as well and they have a huge selection of spreads for them.

Now... The service is pretty terrible. I&#39;ve never dealt with such awful service in Greenpoint. They are way overstaffed and yet, they are absolutely the worst with even paying attention to those that are waiting. One day, there were about six men behind the counter and the restaurant was relatively empty, they still took 5 minutes before they even got to me. They were too concerned with socializing with each other. Also, they&#39;re often quite rude and talk down to you. They forget parts of your order and get pissy when you ask them to correct their mistakes. One time, I didn&#39;t tip because of their terrible service and one of the guys made a smartarsed remark about it. 

The other complaint is their chicken. I&#39;ve gotten their chicken heroes twice now. The first time, the chicken was way too overcooked and didn&#39;t even resemble or taste like meat at that point. The second time, the chicken must&#39;ve been rotten or something. My friend and I both got sick from the heroes. I haven&#39;t been back for lunch since, so, I can&#39;t attest to the quality of the rest of their lunch selections.

Stick to the breakfast basics and they&#39;re fine, but, I&#39;d recommend not going when you&#39;re in a rush. You&#39;ll be standing there like a moron waiting for someone to impolitely serve you. Call your order in ahead of time.",1
"Me and my friend went for dinner last night and everything was very tasty! We had a great time! I actually loved every bit!  My friend has been there several times, but it was my first time. Approximately an hour after we have left we both got stomach cramps. I&#39;ve been running to the bathroom several times, and even now at noon the day after, my stomach is hurting and now I even feel sick and is close to vomiting! I googled to see if someone else has had the same experience. I couldn&#39;t find anything, however I found the horrifying and shockingly facts below, on the NYC Health Ratings Site : http://nychealthratings.netnwww.nychealthratings.net/nycrestapp/restaurantlanding/3/Williamsburg%20-%20North%20Side/26288/The+Meatball+Shop

This is not acceptable, and I don&#39;t understand how they can have an &#39;A&#39; on their window when on the NYC Department of Health site, it says grade N/A meaning their grade should be pending until they fix their problems!

I&#39;m beyond disappointed in the Meatball shop especially since I really liked everything about it, but it&#39;s a huge risk going back to a restaurant that is making me sick!

Please, please, please resolve this problem ASAP!!! Regardless of you making me sick, I will consider giving it another try in the future, just because up until I got sick, I enjoyed it all! Although, if there will be a next time, I will make sure to check the NYC Health Rating site very carefully...",1
We just got food poisoning tonight after splitting a chicken parm hero from Carmine&#39;s.  Unpleasant experience.,1
"Man, what a difference a few months makes. We ordered off the gluten free menu, as usual, but our food was bland and haphazardly thrown together. The socca (chickpea crust pizza) had hardly any sauce in it and the pasta I ordered had virtually no taste. The sausage it was served with seemed like frozen sausage from a bad grocery store. Also, my mom and I both got sick from the meal! Not cool for a restaurant that prides themselves in gluten free knowledge and preparation. Our server was fantastic, at least. I hope they go back to how they were before!",1
"took my cousins from England who worship American BBQ, big mistake, 2 of us got food poisoning and I threw up all the way back to NJ on a bus. All the meats are sub par, the sides are the smallest portion possible, maybe 3 ounces or 3 bites, and were fully prepared well in advance and warmish after microwave treatment. My brisket was tough, cold, fatty and bland, the ribs poor and cold, the chicken dry as anything and no juice. the service pleasantly faked, the southern greens very salty , as if from a can. they pushed beer and soda as fast as the glass reached below half...the bill for 3 adults and 2 kids...$235 without tip. an absolute crime...we called and reported food poisoning, they apologized and said they hoped we&#39;d continue to trust the quality of their food....no free offers, no perks....nothing, I would give it 1 star after further thought. stay away from here and John&#39;s pizza...even worse.",1
Ill never eat here again. 2 of the people who ate here with me got food poisoning a few hours after leaving here!,1
"This place does a lot of things right hence the high ratings which is why a small group of us decided to try it a couple of weeks back.  We indulged in their $1.00 Oysters.  
The first batch was great.  The second batch kept us waiting and by the time we got it the warm oysters tasted &#34;off&#34;.  We all agreed that something wasn&#39;t right but didnt bother mentioning it (probably a mistake).
That night my girlfriend got TERRIBLY sick.  Like BAD.  Her severe case of food poison lasted about a week.  When we called the restaurant and spoke to the owner she seemed concerned - mostly about defending the quality of her food.  We explained to her that it takes only 1 bad oyster and we wanted to let her know.  We also informed her that most of the gang we were with works in that hood and wont be coming back unless she personally invites them for a drink.  Not because they need free drinks but because we were all left with a bad taste in our mouths.  I gave her my girlfriends cell phone number in case she wanted to right the wrong (she assured us that she would call) but we didn&#39;t hear from her (surprising - as a business owner I would welcome the opportunity to make amends with an unhappy client).  Regardless, I had to add this review to YELP regarding the $1.00 Oysters.  Buyer beware.   Eat the Oysters at your own risk.  The owners dont care of the consequences as long as the bill is paid.",1
Simple looking place. Not great service. Food was brought out less then 5 minutes. It seemed microwaved. Gave us FOOD POISONING. not recommended.,1
"The staff is excellent.  I wish I could say the same for the food.  We tried oysters, foie gras, swordfish, pasta etc.  which was pretty average and to top it off...I got food poisoning.  I don&#39;t know what it was, but yeah.  If I want french food next time I&#39;m just going to go to France.",1
"Absolutely THE WORST dining experience I&#39;ve ever had!!!!!! Do not order food here!!! I ordered dumplings, and guess what? They served them to me completely raw... Not undercooked, but completely raw as in they forgot to cook them!! How the f*** do you forget to cook dumplings at all??? I didn&#39;t realize it till my first bite was swallowed and they tried to make up for the salmonella poisoning by giving me some free drink tickets. This place should be reported to the dept of health..",1
"I love to eat here. I have come for brunch a few times, and I make an effort to try something new each time. The disco tots are a great comfort food starter. However, be prepared to not be able to eat anything else, and to feel like shit about yourself for 6 months. 

I will say that my boyfriend and I came here after our trip to Las Vegas, just to put the excess over the top. We were so excited to visit one of our fave guilty pleasures. About 10 minutes after we got home, he said &#34;Is it cold in here?&#34; Needless to say, he had severe food poisoning from the Perfect Storm (salmon and egg item) he ate at QC. I was really surprised, and we haven&#39;t come back since.",1
"It is with heavy heart that I tell you I have lost my favorite Indian restaurant. 

The one thing I had that my husband didn&#39;t was one measly meat samosa. It was the reason I got horrific food poisoning. I can never go back there for I have indianfoodophobia now :(",1
"The buffalo wings looked like they were a week old. They were dry and looked like prunes i dont even know why my friend even ate it...She began to feel sick and the server offered to ask the chef to cook a fresh batch. I really had to ask him, if you are agreeing with me that it looks old... then why would you bring it out to us in the first place? never again",1
"Went here for a lunch with co-workers and had the classic burger with 5N sauce. It tasted okay, but I started to feel a little funny after eating it. About 24 hours later, I had food poisoning and I&#39;m 100% sure it was this burger. Won&#39;t be back.",1
"Food poisoning! I had lo mein noodles, sesame chicken, and tofu here at terminal 4 around 10:15 am before catching a flight. The noodles tasted a bit sour, and I thought it was because of vinegar. Then I had diarrhea 3 times in the next 6 hours -- twice on the plane and once when I am connecting now. Never had this strong urge to write a review so soon.",1
"Two words: food poisoning (it must have been that weird looking beef that I knew I shouldn&#39;t eat). While I&#39;m sure you can get it anywhere, I&#39;m not surprised I got it here.",1
"Sad.



That would sum it up. 



Ordered through Seamless.com for delivery. Delivery guy is the same as what some other reviewers say: waited in the car while we had to go down to him to get it. We had ordered Roti, Naan, Paneer Tikka Masala, and Chicken Makhani. Breads were warm and the entrees were room temp. The food was absolutely bland. Both the Paneer and the Makhani. I would&#39;ve been better off making instant ramen for dinner. It was like all my taste buds went missing and I was just chewing... well, nothing. 



From now on I&#39;ll only go to Jackson Heights for my indian food fix. 



Sorry, Royal India Palace, but I won&#39;t be returning my business here.



Update: Was 2 stars before, bumped it down to 1 because my bf got sick from his food.",1
So much oil and MSG!! Afterwards I was soooo thirsty. And my hubby had diarrhea later. No good at all!  Never going back.,1
"Keeping it short and simple but whoever reviewed and said they got sick eating here is not lying. Been having a bout of food poisoning ever since I came here on Saturday evening and had their Sasuke pre fixe meal. $68 or so for the runs, amazing.



Pros: 

Atmosphere is ok, but the ninjas didn&#39;t seem to be trying that hard.

The food tasted ok, 3/5 kind of ok



Cons:

Small room for 10 people

Lots of screaming and yelling as their &#34;ninja&#34; effects

Their so-called presentation special effects all involved lighting the food on fire, not much variety.

Asked for medium rare steak, instead got medium and it was cold and tough to cut

Ceviche and fish of the day tasted great, but something in there was poison I tell ya.





Without the food poisoning at most a 3 star experience, with the food poisoning I wish I could give them a zero.",1
"Recently I&#39;ve had to make some diet changes and was excited to find a vegan restaurant near to my job. Getting lunch at a vegan place makes it so much easier to be healthy, right? No.



In all fairness the first few times I&#39;ve ordered food here I have enjoyed it. I&#39;m mostly referring to their veggie burrito and side salad with their house dressing. I also liked the spinach quesadilla with Daiya &#34;cheese.&#34;



Yesterday I ordered the Udon Soup entree thinking it would be something fairly gentle for my stomach. The ingredients didn&#39;t sound dangerous (bean curd--which is apparently non-GMO soy, seaweed, scallion, and carrot/ginger in a vegetable broth). It was INCREDIBLY salty and I soon started to feel a sick full feeling. I spent the rest of the day obscenely bloated and later in the night became sick. I will admit I do have digestive problems but the extreme reaction I had happens RARELY. 



On the menu it clearly states &#34;NO MSG&#34; but I&#39;m wondering if it is used after all in the Udon Soup based on how sick I became later in the evening. If it wasn&#39;t MSG then there&#39;s too much soy sauce or something.



Other than looking 3-4 months pregnant after eating their soup this specific location is obscenely small. There are about 4 small circular tables you can eat at with a booth running along one side and on the opposite side small uncomfortable looking seats that remind me of an hourglass you&#39;d use while playing a board game.



The clientele ranges from young and obviously vegan to yuppy old rich people who have shiny plastic surgery cheekbones who think they can hog a table and chat for hours. The fliers, pictures of celebrity vegans, and the large tv that only airs vegan related topics comes off a tad self righteous in my opinion.  



If you don&#39;t have food intolerances and a stomach of steel then Loving Hut may be good enough for you. But I would suggest staying away from the soups and stick with the vegetable dishes.",1
"Besides the fact that I got very sick, very quickly for the lobster omelet I ordered, my friend and I also had lipstick stains on the glasses when we received our mimosas. I doubt I&#39;ll be coming back.",1
"This place is right on the corner of my apartment, and there is always lots of people. My boyfriend and I finally decided to give it a try a few weeks ago. After a 45 min wait, we finally got a table outside. Drinks were good, and so was the food. I got the goat cheese sandwich, and as good as it tasted while eating it, I was sick all night :( The ingredients in the sandwich seemed fresh, but maybe the people preparing it werent sanitary? Who knows. If I go back, it will only be for the bar!",1
The only thing that has compelled me to take action faster than my decision to write this review of Atlas was an unfortunate case of food poisoning that left me spewing out of my ass for two days.  I&#39;ll leave it at that.,1
"Oh my God. I came here last Thursday for a quick bite after work and got food poisoning!!!!! I ordered the chicken bowl with the mild sauce, beans, cheese and guac. Got sick literally 5 minutes after walking out of this place. I will never EVER have chipotle again.",1
"Even though I read some bad reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try, and to be honest, I am more than disappointed and unhappy with the outcome. I will never order from here again. I ordered fries and chicken fingers, and the guy said it would take about 45 minutes. About an hour and a half later, I called back and asked where my order was. He said they should be there in a minute. I said ok and hung up, only to receive my order a half hour later. At first, the delivery man did not want to make the simple walk up the front steps. I felt that he was just taking advantage of the fact that I&#39;m 14 and thought that I was going to go along with whatever he wanted to do. After I made it clear that I was under no circumstances going to come outside, he reluctantly climbed the stairs and gave me my order. I did not feel like tipping him at all. When I opened the food, I was disappointed. The chicken tasted like no other chicken had ever tasted before; it was the worst. And on top of that, the fries were cold and you could tell that the steam from the once hot meal had made it a bit soggy. It was the worst meal ever, but I was extremely hungry and continued to eat it. But I was a little surprised at how little time it took me to feel full, but I overlooked that. Fast forward to two days later, I feel nauseous and have loose stools, and I feel sick everytime I think about any kind of chicken. I don&#39;t have a loss of appetite, and I doubt its food poisoning, but I am never EVER ordering from this place again, and I suggest you don&#39;t either. This also serves as a future warning for me and everyone else: NEVER try a place with more bad ratings than good. It will only backfire badly.",1
"This bar is pretty standard in terms of UES bars. The waitstaff were attentive, but not as much as some places. Our waitress only brought us 2 rounds before forgetting about us. One bonus is they do table-taps of Coors for $20, which equates to about 6 beers. The food tasted great, but the next day my boyfriend had food poisoning. Watch out for beef burgers!",1
i got food poisoning - do not go!!,1
"I&#39;ve tried this place a few times and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion it&#39;s to be avoided if you don&#39;t wanna feel like you&#39;ve wasted your money on poorly made food served by rude people. First time I went it wasn&#39;t great. The chicken katsu was basically nothing like chicken katsu. What I got was dry chicken with a weird, overpowering barbecue sauce that tasted more like ketchup than anything else. I also ordered an avocado salad which was literally an avocado on a few pieces of lettuce. No dressing, no cucumber, no tomatoes, nothing. $5 well spent. Anyway all in all it was edible, just underwhelming and a bit weird, so I decided to try it again, assuming I&#39;d maybe just ordered the wrong dishes. Boy, was I wrong. Second time around, Shrimp tempura and a pork noodle dish equaled full on food poisoning. I know this because I hadn&#39;t eaten anything all day and within 30 mins of picking at what I&#39;d ordered, because again, it was pretty bad food, I became really, really sick. Never again. People who say this place is great have gotta be out of their minds.",1
"Two unpleasant words: FOOD POISONING. 



After eating here, I was stricken with a bout of food poisoning that definitely made me an unhappy camper. Regardless of whether or not I had gotten sick though, I wouldn&#39;t have returned as the food could most generously be described as mediocre. 



Whipped Ricotta &amp; Nduja: Three small silvers of focaccia with the whipped ricotta and nduja on top that could be finished in two bites. There was literally no flavor at all. I kept trying to figure out what nduja tasted like, and constantly searched for the taste of ricotta or even the focaccia, but alas - nothing. I might as well have not eaten anything at all. 



Prosciutto Wrapped Dates: Just the opposite. These were sickly sweet. To the point of having to douse each bite with water. Each time I took a bite my mouth became sticky and hard to chew. 



The Bone Marrow: Ah, their namesake dish. The marrow itself overpowered the sea urchin. And the bread that it came with was charred to a blackened shadow of its former self. I have a sneaking suspicion that the sea urchin was what made me sick. I&#39;ve eaten tons of sea urchin before (yum), but this time I could sense it was off and the texture was odd. Scary to think their most popular dish could&#39;ve gotten me sick! 



Blistered String Beans: We needed a veggie dish. Overall it was ok as well. The tiny portion couldn&#39;t justify 12 dollars though. 



Pork Belly: This was their special of the day, and the waitress really pushed it. As an individual who loves pork belly, I was also disappointed by this. They did some sort of caramelizing to the top and bottom, but when eaten it would turn into a sticky, sticky mess that was impossible to swallow. I ended up having to cut away the caramelized part and just eating the middle. Such a sad waste. 



Overall, their only saving grace was their tiny pretzel rolls. But the waitstaff seemed reluctant to give us seconds, and quickly took our bread plates away and olive oil without asking if we&#39;d like refills. Such a shame that such an expensive meal was wasted.",1
"My bf and I decided to try this place out last weekend. We had seen it on an episode of Diners, Dives, and Drive Ins. It&#39;s not that big of a place but very ethnic looking. We sat and had some guac and chips. They also put some salsa and tomatillo sauce on the table as condiments. Really spicy stuff! Gave the guac a great kick. The bf tried the weekend special ($2), a fried jalapeno stuff with chicken, wrapped in a tortilla. He said it was really good. We ordered a bunch of tacos to take home for the fam. We had shrimp, chicken, fish, rojas, and one with cactus. Everyone enjoyed them, but by the time we got home it was a bit soggy. By guess is, they&#39;re best eaten at the restaurant. I def want to go back and try some of the other stuff on the menu. Their food is SUPER reasonable. Like $2-3 for tacos!! Great food, great service.. will def return. My only complaint issss.. With the tacos we took home, they gave us some extra salsa and tomatillo sauce. After we ate, there was some left over so I just put it all in the fridge. The next day when I had some of the salsa, I got food poisoning. I&#39;m pretty sure it was because of the salsa because it was the only different thing I ate from everyone else in my family that day and I was the only one who got sick. However, we all ate the food as soon as we brought it home from the restaurant the day before and we were all fine. I&#39;m guessing the sauce probably spoiled overnight. But food poisoning aside, I will def return to eat IN the restaurant.",1
"I got very sick from eating here.

The young guys that keep the buffet filled, place the empty trays on top of the full trays when swiching them.  Can you picture lifting a tray from the steam table and placing the bottom of it onto the top of a tray full of food?  This is what they do.  I saw it but didnt take it seriously enough.  I got sick that night - very very sick.

Placing dirty metal (these trays have been on countertops, etc.) onto food!

I will never eat from there again and I warn you that what you don&#39;t see them do could be worse than what I saw them do!

I would rather have root canal than go through the pain, etc. I suffered for their carelessness.   

Be warned.",1
A policeman recommended this cart. I must say that the people working there are delightful - funny and friendly. My group ordered the chicken over rice. Two of us took several bites and then threw out the rest. I ate much more and got sick from it. Avoid this cart.,1
"This place sucks.



The staff changed and their food and it&#39;s quality went down considerably.  Consistently messed up so many orders that I gave up ordering from here altogether.  My last food order from here involved an egg based dish that came with shards of eggshell. One time a co-worker stopped in for a salmon-based sandwich and ended up taking it back AND they refunded her money as they admitted that it had gone bad.



Now to top it off a co-worker and I stopped here in a rush and bought identically prepared ice coffees without sugar and a splash of milk.  We had not eaten anything that day and he got sick with diarrhea all day.  



Seals the deal for me: Never again....not even as a last resort.",1
"Arg I spent the first half of the week recovering from food poisoning after dining at the Sunday buffet. Funny thing is that I don&#39;t recall eating much raw seafood - perhaps 2 raw oysters.. and my butt was glued to the toilet seat for 2 days. The variety has changed since we visited last winter - less expensive items such as uni and oyster, more stuff like.. baked fish and coconut shrimp - where you can probably get at ordinary Chinese buffets for half the price. The only station I can never say no to is the crepe station - Warm crispy crepe with a scope of red bean and a scope of green tea ice cream on the side.  However no matter how awesome the crepe was.. definitely not worth the 40 dollar per person price tag.... and the bathroom visits.",1
"It was just bad...



We went for brunch. The steak and eggs was gross. The eggs were alright but the steak was horrible. Little bits of rubbery overcooked London broil. My wife&#39;s meal had a LONG hair in it... 



We both felt sick when we left. 



Won&#39;t be going back.",1
"Non-existent service.

No AC on a hot day.

The worst food poisoning of my life! I am traumatized for life now! :&#39;(",1
"I assume the name &#34;Sevens&#34; is derived from the number of hours it takes to get food, the percentage amount they care about customers, and their health inspection rating. 



Food is terrible, I got sick from eating here after I found several hairs and packaging stickers in my soup, falafel AND my hummus. This was after I waited over an hour for my food. 



Summary: avoid, avoid, avoid!!



Ps: they don&#39;t have tabbouleh here. Bullshit!!",1
"So this is an update to warn you about the food quality and customer service that has gone completely downhill. My husband and I order breaded chicken sandwiches (pollo a la Milanesa) from this restaurant a couple of months ago and we both got SO SICK. I threw up a few hours after eating the food and my husband had a stomach ache all night and ended up vomiting the sandwich in the morning!  Of course we said we would never try this restaurant ever again. However Today I was in the mood for the fresh food I had gotten in the past and decided to give them another shot.

I placed my order with a young lady and upon completely my order I politely asked that the food please be fresh because the previous time we had ordered it wasn&#39;t fresh. She very rudely responded that it was Impossible for the food not to have been fresh. I replied by saying I have always been satisfied with their food quality except for the last time that my husband and I got sick. She then sassily and disrespectfully said &#34;well  then maybe there is something wrong with you and your husbands stomach&#34;

I canceled the order and I vow never to eat from the place again. I wouldn&#39;t want to throw up again or find myself in a situation where the staff is arguing with me. Steer clear of this place. Tomo Japanese caf? is right next to them and are a wonderful choice if  you are in the area",1
"I used to go here all the time when I was a carnivore, mostly for the ludicrousness...classy patrons it has none of...just a wild scene of rib eatin&#39; big ice tea drinkin&#39; NYC crew...food is mass mass produced and aways got me sick, but fun...watch the giant drinks! one step up from Arby&#39;s, ten steps down from any non-chain eatery.",1
I&#39;ve eaten here twice. Gotten food poisoning once and the other time just sucked. Incredibly mediocre food with awful service. They call this tapas? More like crapas,1
This I must say us the worst pizza in New York. The first time I ate this pizza I got food poisoning. Nobody is ever in there. Slices are reheated and look like they have been sitting there for an hour. Take lessons from Amore Pizza in Flushing. The best!!,1
"The food is absolutely fresh and well executed. Very nice presentation and taste. But I believe that we don&#39;t have to be in a sort of dive place, where floor and tables are uneven and wagging, to get good food. 
  What about the service? Horrible! Dirty! Disgusting! The waitress are all dressed up very casually in beat up jeans with cell phones hanging out of their rear pocket and random t-shirts. They are constantly checking their dirty and full-of-bacteria phones in front of customers and touching their hair and with the same bare hands that do all that, they serve raw food to their patrons. That is cross-contamination! It is a very serious health violation!
  Of course I felt very uncomfortable eating here and I stay quite because I didn&#39;t want to disappoint my friends that brought me here. But, I confess, I avoided as much as I could!
  I feel great to be alive after that experience! And I wonder how many customers felt sick right after eating here!",0
Worst case of food poisoning from this restaurant. I&#39;ve been sick for the last 24 hours.,1
My husband just confessed to me that he got super diarrhea from their Grilled Spicy Miso Sea Bass.  I guess we won&#39;t be going back......,1
"My review is an average of my two experiences. The first time I came here was after a drunken bar night. I came solo like the lone wolf that I am and ordered a chicken quesadilla. The food was decent...until I saw a roach. Yup, right next to my seat on the floor. I immediately felt sick to my stomach. I told the waiter and the manager. I thought I&#39;d never return again. Apparently that was short lived and I recently returned after a drunken night for a hungover breakfast. I ordered chocolate chip pancakes, scrambled eggs and home fries and they were all pretty good. I erased the roach from my memory apparently and was able to eat there. Overall, I would go to any other diner instead of this one, but I did go back after the roach experience so that just explains the type of person I am: a fat ass.",0
"Medium-sized place in Chinatown with a no-frills dining style.  You basically sit with other people at tables with hard seats and have to decide if you want to eat with chopsticks or forks.  The food is ok, it&#39;s not wonderful and it&#39;s not horrible.  The beef and broccoli is basic and the lo mein is not the usual kind you would find in take-out places.  Again, it was just barely ok.

Maybe it&#39;s me but when I saw the ducks and chickens hanging in the windows, I immediately felt a little sick.  It didn&#39;t help that it happened to be 93 degrees when I came here with a couple of friends but that sight has always been somewhat unsettling to me.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve seen plenty of meat before, as my father has been a butcher for over forty years.  It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t like the idea of food hanging on hooks in plain view and out in the open.

Yeah, it&#39;s cheap and they only take cash, so there&#39;s that.  Would I come here again?  Only if I was absolutely starving and dragged in by my friend, who really likes it a lot.  Even then, I would try to play along but I&#39;m pretty sure this would never be a regular spot for me.",0
"I received food poisoning from this place last week. 
My usual local standard for breakfast and iced coffee, I purchased a #4 egg white wrap with sausage and cheese and an iced coffee. Eating nothing else that day, within 6 hours exactly I was driving to south Jersey and having to pull over on the Turnpike. 
Either cross-contamination of eggs or water contamination of the ice or spoiled milk (?) -- something made me violently ill all afternoon and into the evening. 
I will never eat here again!!",1
"If I could give this place zero stars, I would! For starters, the bathroom is FILTHY. I&#39;ve seen dumpsters cleaner! That rag over the bathroom sink is used to wipe up any messes and &#34;spills&#34; in the stalls, then is placed right over the spot customers wash their hands. Disgusting, no? The food is generally under- or overcooked, laden with hair strands, and, from two separate occasions, nail clippings! All of their seafood and mushroom dishes are sprinkled with sand, which unpleasantly crunches between the teeth. Their ice cream is usually never frozen and the Jell-O is dusty. Most dishes are either chipped or still dirty with a prior diner&#39;s meal leftovers. 

Parents, beware -- the servers and manager are NOT kid-friendly! With a newly strict &#34;no sharing&#34; policy, the restaurant employees hawk over tables with young kids who tend to pick at the parents&#39; plates. They claimed a child in my family was at fault for taking a crab claw from his father&#39;s plate, when he just wanted to play with it. They ceaselessly harassed my family until we were FORCED to leave. Plus, my sister and I get food poisoning from EVERY visit, so, without a doubt, we are NEVER going back!",1
"Where can I start with this? Rude staff, awful food and I got food poisoning! Not to mention the ridiculous sticker of Tip is not included. It was completely condescending. Not to mention we requested sauces and it took 20 minutes to get them, and we didn&#39;t even get extra napkins until the 4th time we asked for some. Servers were pretty much doing their own thing and we could hear their whole conversations from our table. I love BBQ food but this place was disgusting and left much to be desired.",1
"I remember my first experience at Pequena being brunch and it was pretty good and I will say it is probably why I&#39;m ok with it getting 1 star. Lately I feel as though they are failing in every way. Here&#39;s a list:

- Got delivery and ordered the black bean and plantain quesadilla. It is such a good idea if it was excuted well. The plantains were HARD and HALF SWEET. For people who are from the tropics this is an unforgiveable act. At another time I tried to order it again and specifically asked for ripe plantains they said that plantains are not in season so they are going to be hard. I don&#39;t see how the dominican restaurant down the street (or my own mother) can somehow find ripe plantains but they can&#39;t. I promptly cancelled my order. They should stop making excuses and do better.

- Went this week, sat down with a friend and almost ran out 3 minutes after because the whole restaurant smelled like diarrhea. I think that&#39;s all I really need to say about that.

-Tried once more for brunch bc I actually like their brunch menu. My friend and I sat down and was immediately attacked by flies which is DISGUSTING. We are not talking about 2 here or there. There were like 10 flies buzzing around the whole restaurant.  Oh, and my friend vomited herself to sleep that night (wondering if this is related to the diarrhea)

- Waitresses at first are nice but are actually ridiculously inattentive which is amazing bc the restaurant is all of 100 sq ft. There were about 4 waitresses and NO ONE sitting outside yet I had to wait and wait for someone to notice that I needed my check. I almost got up to talk to them bc no one was actually doing their job.

-Their guacamole is digusting. My friends and I ordered some for the table and we had them take it back bc it was gross. I really am not a food snob/ connoisseur but I think when you know, you know.

- The white sangria is just sad.

- For the love of God, just accept credit cards! It is 2013!

- Pequena, you need to slow your roll on these prices, &#39;cause it&#39;s MEXICAN food and you are doing the BARE minimum. Really though? $9 for a single shrimp tostada? Get your life.

Everyone is prob reading this like &#39;why do u go back?&#39; Sometimes you are in a jam and just THAT desperate, and sometimes you hold onto the ONE good experience you had a yr ago. But at this point I would rather go to the McD&#39;s on Atlantic than come near that place.",0
"I&#39;m sorry, nice neighborhood, great service, deliciously rich, generously portioned food AND free corkage?!??!! How. How is this possible? 

Food:
What I ordered can best be described as a creamy pie of seafood with a crispy breadcrumb crust. No idea what it was actually called. Doesn&#39;t really matter. It was rich and delicious and I sopped up the sauce with a fair share of the bread served at the table. The 4 vegetable sides provided with our entrees (and generously replenished over and over) were light, tasty and a perfect break from the richness of my dish (I alternated back and forth til I felt sick) 

My date had a stew of some sort with cannellini beans, tomato, garlic Duck confit, slab bacon &amp; pork sausage all braised with Noble duck fat... I would order this next time in a heart beat. the meaty richness permeates everything, esp the cannellini beans. I salivate just thinking about it. 

Atmosphere:
Quite the date spot, lots of couples with one or two (no judgment) bottles of wine to share. Dark , romantic, but not stuffy or &#34;fancy&#34;.. perfect in-the-middle-ness.

Overall:
If I lived in NY I would definitely make this a regular spot until my clothes stopped fitting..",0
"I got a plain grilled cheese because you have to get that right. It was ok pretty greasy and cheesy. The staff was very friendly but the place is pretty grungey. Prices are kind of on the high side for bread and cheese. 

Why I gave 2 stars: 1) I can make a better sandwich with better ingredients.
                                2) The sandwich made me SICK, and I never or rarely get food poisoning. (Not surprising considering how dirty everything was)

with that being said I don&#39;t think I will be returning.",1
I was sick and a friend ordered me food from Spice Symphony - it was so good that I didn&#39;t even feel sick any more! Their aloo gobi was particularly good and the breads came so fresh!,0
dont eat here. I ate a burger here and got food poisoning. they have numerous dept of health violations like mouse droppings etc. They got an f rating. The owner is a rude jerk who fights over those free toppings tuesday. If you stilll want to endanger your  health watch out for the plastic kiddy menu- because it is not clear that cheeses and other stuff are all not toppings.  you will be overcharged getting toppings for free- they are not free; food is not good here and the place is unhygienic.,1
"HORRID EXPERIENCE!

Ok, I&#39;ve ordered their food before and had no problem. But this time.... WOAH!

Walked in the other night, about 8 PM, it&#39;s just as hot inside the restaurant as it was outside (85 degrees). They have ONE air conditioner, above the door. Did nothing to cool off the room. I didn&#39;t think much of it, but... I was wrong. I get home, which is 1 block away, eat and feel fine. Didn&#39;t taste funny or fishy.  3 am I wake up with severe stomach pain. 7 am I&#39;m throwing up and have diarrhea. Turns out the sushi was bad and I had a mild case of food poisoning all day yesterday, July 8. I&#39;m still feeling it today. I called Sushi Sushi mid-day to tell them about my horrible pain and experience and received &#34;OK, I&#39;ll tell my boss right now&#34;. No offer of a refund. $17 - down the drain, literally. 

Word to the Wise - don&#39;t go to this place during the summer. Their equipment isn&#39;t strong enough to keep their food from spoiling.",1
"I have been coming here since 2009. 
I am a regular customer here and it feels so good they remember exactly what I like. They know I never take top water, ask for Japanese tea with Splenda and always need extra ginger. They literally bring all of that along with menus :)
The prices are super affordable. The fish is always fresh. I tried almost everything on the menu and brought all the possible friends over, and nobody ever got sick. 
Such a great spot. Very casual atmosphere. The waiters can be funny sometimes, but it this point I don&#39;t care: they are super friendly and food is so good.",0
"When my friend and I saw the morning star&#39;s menu from the outside we thought it could be a nice place to eat. However, not only did the waitress put in the wrong order for our appetizers, she did not put in our entree orders until after an hour of us sitting and waiting for the food. The server was also very rude and intrusive, making frivolous and inappropriate comments about the paperwork we were filling up at our table. 
All in all, worst diner experience I&#39;ve ever had, the food was ok, but not great, and I ended up getting sick after eating their veggie burger.",1
"Beware of the shrimp.
I&#39;m giving Khao Sarn a 3 Star rating because they have been my favorite Thai food spot in Williamsburg for many years.  
Unfortunately, the last two times I ordered a shrimp dish via delivery, the shrimp smelled &#34;fishy&#34; or in other words NOT Fresh. On both occasions I ate the shrimp, ignoring my instincts.  First time, I was okay.  The second time, I woke up the next day feeling terribly sick and missed a day of work as a result of it.  
Hopefully, this is not the beginning of a decline in their food quality.  I will likely eat here again, but will not order the shrimp.",1
Three out of three of us got food poisoning here Sunday night. It&#39;s now Wednesday and we&#39;re all still sick. The only things we all three ate in common were French fries and the water. So whatever the contamination was must have been all over the place. Be warned.,1
"I came here last year in the summer after hearing so many good things about this place, and this ramen shop definitely did not disappoint!! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!

Don&#39;t be surprised if you have to wait an incredibly long time. I recommend just waiting it out for a seat because it&#39;s so worth it! Also, the wait isn&#39;t too bad because there are some chairs around in the front as well as a bar. I came here around 10 PM after watching the NY Phil and had to wait about 30 minutes, which wasn&#39;t too bad. One thing about the seating policy is that the staff won&#39;t seat you until everyone in your party is present, so make sure your party is complete by the time they call your name, or else someone else will take your place! 

For appetizers, we ordered the pork buns, crab croquettes, and house salad. The pork buns were delicious. The amount of meat was a decent amount and was juicy, not dry (like some other places). The sauce kicked it out of the park. I&#39;ve tried several pork buns from many other places and I have to say, Ippudo&#39;s sauce is my favorite so far. Also, they use butter lettuce in the bun and well, I&#39;m a sucker for butter lettuce. The crab croquettes were divine. The outside was golden brown and very crisp. The inside was so creamy, but light! When eating croquettes, I tend to feel really heavy after eating them but the ones here were not the case. The surrounding sauce matched the croquettes so harmoniously. As for the house salad, the dressing was really light and flavorful. The greens were fresh, except for a few leafs that looked a little sickly, but overall it was a really good, standard house salad. 

I ordered the Akaharu Modern ramen and it was soooo good. The broth was flavor packed and the noodles were so fresh. Also, the pieces of pork were very good and absorbed the flavor of the broth, making it even more savory. 

The service here is really friendly and whether they are really busy or not doesn&#39;t make a difference because they are very efficient. I came here twice, dinner and lunch, and had really good vibes from the staff during both occasions. 

Also, the lunch and dinner menu are different in terms of the number of appetizers. There are more appetizers in the evening, so I definitely recommend going then.",0
"i know they claim to offer gluten free food, I have had 2 sandwiches in the past year.. both times I got sick..not sure if they are careful enough for super-sentivities... at least not for me...

I wrote the first time off... but after 2 times.. no dice... it is really too bad as I work 1 block away.... would love to hear if any supersentive GF&#39;ers do better than I did",0
"I discovered this place after I started working in Chelsea and i was looking for a less corporate go-to coffee shop for my morning caffeine kick. It didn&#39;t take long for me to get addicted to their selection of coffees and baked muffins leading to me getting their lunch sandwiches as well. After frequenting the cafe more than 13 times within 10 business days I encountered my first MOLDY MUFFIN! The worst part is, the mold was forming on the bottom rim of the muffin and because I was eating it from the top, I didn&#39;t notice until I was midway through! In Shock, I brought the other half back to the cafe and even the cashier was stunned after I showed her! She apologized and in the midst of the moment (she may have been struck by stupidity) but asked me if I wanted another muffin rather than a refund. I&#39;m not the type of person to make a scene so I kindly declined and got my money back.
I was so upset over this incident, not so much about the mold (since it did not make me sick) but because their food tasted SOOOOOOOOOO good and now I didn&#39;t feel like I could trust their quality.
I waited approximately 1 week and couldn&#39;t resist the urge any longer...I decided to go back and get their parmesian eggplant sandwich. If this visit had no issues I definitely would still go there, but it may have been a coincidence where the large piece of cheese on my sandwich looked as though there were little white/clear fuzzy things on it! I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES! I asked my co-worker to look at it confirming it was mold! I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and believe it was pieces of the wax paper stuck to the cheese, but wax paper just doesn&#39;t leave that type of fuzzy residue. I was so disappointed, not to mention I did get a stomach ache this time from the food.  I really wish this place would just carry more &#34;fresh&#34; food items, practice better hygiene (maybe just check the muffins they leave sitting out in the pan), because I honestly did LOVE the food here.  I just can&#39;t bring myself to go here anymore because I&#39;m scared of what is going to be growing on/in my food...Not to mention the employees are super nice. *sigh* Another good place lost",0
actually zero- I ate a burger here and got food poisoning- the meat was bad-- found it- they got an f rating from the dept of health- and they have numerous violations such as mouse droppings- they are going to be shut down due to their numerous violations- however if yous till want to endanger your health- beware of free toppings- its deceptive- heres why- cheese sauce onions are all toppings right? not according to the ahole owner- he  charges for the toppings which he states are not toppings- fraud- when i asked the owner - he is rude and argumentive-i am asking refund for the sickening food- and abusive treatment- dont eat here - living socials;  groupons etc- are not really discounted- they are overcharging for filthy dirty food - and unhygienic,1
My two colleagues ate from the truck this afternoon and are both sick as dogs. They did not go together but were there at different times. The two gals were vomiting this afternoon and one just left the office very ill.,1
"love this bar...super chill, always a spot available either at the bar or a table.  sick cocktails.  bartenders are always nice....good pours on wine!",0
"After waiting 2 hours for a table, I think my expectations were too high for this place. 

I would give it 4 stars but my friend and I had really bad indigestion or some stomach problems right after eating the butter drench, garlic food.

We got the Shrimp and Crawfish combo, snowcrab and the lobster and crawfish.. the lobster combo was $40 because it&#39;s &#34;marketprice&#34; but why wouldn&#39;t they just have that on the menu?

The shrimp and the snowcrabs were my favorite the cajun wings were really juicy and flavorful. I really like garlic (not powder, salt, seasoning) raw garlic and the boil uses LOTS of it.

After  20 minutes into eating, I felt sick and the food was too greasy with butter so I asked for rice, which the server got the saddest side of rice which didn&#39;t even look like a bowl of rice but a square of rice... I didn&#39;t even know rice could all mesh together like mash potato and be shaped that way. On top of that I was charged $3 for it.



cash only. ugh.",0
"No. Just don&#39;t. Even the exceptional wait staff can not, in any way, make up for the poor quality, over-priced food. The only way to get more MSG into food, would be to eat MSG straight from the bag. I feel sick. I often wonder if all the rave reviews for joints this bad come from friends and family members.",0
"Some friends and I decided to go to here because they had a gluten-free menu, which came in handy for my friend who has a gluten allergy. We ordered a few drinks before we had dinner, and the drinks were great. I had the Strawberry Fields cocktail, which came with plenty of crushed strawberries.

When we ordered dinner, we ordered a few things off the gluten-free menu for our friend to enjoy. We ordered the Essex Street Pickles, Red Snapper Tacos, and Herb-dusted Frites from the gluten-free menu. Our waitress came back a few minutes later, saying that it was probably not safe for our friend to eat the Red Snapper Tacos and frites because they were fried in the same fryer as other items not listed on the special menu. So, pretty much, their gluten-free menu was pointless. They replaced her items with a salmon salad, but still charged us for it. She got sick the morning after, which probably goes to show that they weren&#39;t very careful with their food preparation either.

Overall, the food was nothing special. This place is good for the cocktails, but eat dinner elsewhere. And don&#39;t bring friends with celiac disease.",0
"This use to be my go to IHOP spot until an omelette I had made me sick for a couple days. Cleanliness is definitely an issue, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go back.",1
"Arrghhh. I so badly want to give this place 5 stars. At the same time I want to give it 1 star. Before you stone me, let me explain!

The food here is OUTSTANDING. I had chicken over rice that was perfectly cooked and ridiculously flavorful. Five stars by any normal account. While waiting on line they even gave us a free piece of falafel. You will never find a crispier falafel anywhere. The only con to it was that it was actually on the dry side.

Why the minus stars?
They&#39;re freakin&#39; -filthy-! 
Dude. I don&#39;t give a damn about eating food off a street cart, or tamales made by some old Spanish lady&#39;s bare hands, or rice cakes cooked by some Chinese woman in a store front that&#39;s the size of my closet. That&#39;s normally great, authentic, culturally rich food. And I&#39;ve eaten some very questionable food in my time. I was raised Filipino, where i learned to &#34;pick off the bad parts and eat the rest.&#34; My stomach may not be totally made of iron, but I can handle food from a place the Dept. of Health would rate a C (you can get away with a lot and still get an A/B, I worked in the food bizz for a few years).

The problem here is that none of these dudes changed their gloves once. I saw them stick their hands in raw falafel mix, handle cash money, and the -worst- offense, handle a filthy garbage container covered in wet rancid scrap-food mess to dump it into the nasty C-town dumpster a few yards away. AND NEVER CHANGED THEIR GLOVES. And then! stick their hands in a basket of cooked falafel to hand it as samples to people waiting on line! Wtf!

I didn&#39;t finish my chicken platter the night I got it because:
a) It was very filling and
b) I was busy peeing out of my ass after eating it.

BUT. Just to convey how delicious the food was, I STILL ate some of the left overs the next day because:
a) It was delicious
b) Someone stole my lunch at work and I didn&#39;t eat anything all day.

Famished, I risked it a second time. Yes, stupid, my fault, and like damn clockwork I found myself pooping out everything I just consumed. On the plus side, this could be a really great diet. You get to eat amazing food and dump it all out before your body gets to absorb any calories. 

Seriously, if it wasn&#39;t for their complete lack of hygienic practices, this place would easily be five stars.
Come here if you like the combination of tasty street food and playing the exhilarating game of seeing how long you can hold your diarrhea before crapping your pants. 

PS. Ask them to change their gloves.",1
"I&#39;ve tried with this place but it sucks. My boyfriend had horrible food poisoning after I suggested watching the Giants game during the 2011-2012 playoffs. We went back recently because the options in Harlem are scarce. (I miss Lenox Lounge). In any event, my girls and I headed here after pregaming at The Social. Had a few drinks, nothing amazing. When I am out with my homegirls, I definitely want them to at least talk to a cute guy, that wasn&#39;t happening at Harlem Tavern. If you want to meet other singles this place is only OK if there is an actual sporting event on TV. I can&#39;t see why else you would come here, the food isn&#39;t good and the service sucks. This was my 4th visit and probably my last.",1
Never again! My coworker and I got sick because of something we ate from there! Probably the yum yum sauce being that it&#39;s sitting out in the heat for so long! *TIP FOR THE OWNERS* Refrigerate your condiments!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Sick metal bar in Queens, pretty close to the Queens Center Mall. Its a great spot to see local NYC metal bands on a Friday or Saturday night and drink. Awesome sound system too.  Could use some drink specials though.",0
"Horrible case of food poisoning from a burger eaten at this seriously overpriced diner... my guy suffered with vomiting and diarrhea all night.  Something bad is going on in this joint&#39;s kitchen.  Met patrons who find it convenient, as we did: be warned.",1
"Revolting!

My dinner companion and I were the last table for the evening (after the filet was returned because it was overcooked) and as we were finishing the manager started yelling at the staff. So much so that I went up to him and told him to cut it out. He did not. We tried to get out of there as fast as we could. TOTALLY ugly behavior and really disrupted a good night. Dude is a total a$$hole. Do not support this restaurant that doesn&#39;t regard the peace of its patrons. Reminded me of Amy&#39;s Baking Company from Kitchen Nightmares.

Special added bonus: either they tainted that beef before they brought it to our table again or something else revolting caused my companion to end up in the hospital next day with extreme food poisoning. F**k these guys and their average menu, their despicable behavior and their poisonous food.",1
"Be very careful with this place. Went here with 4 people, me and my gf both came out with food poisoning for the next 2-3 days (had to take off work). Don&#39;t let the nice presentation off food fool you. The portions are pretty big for the value but then again what&#39;s the value of it when u end up vommiting for the next 3 days? Oh and this place is tiny.",1
"As someone who eats sushi on a regular basis, I have plenty to compare this place to.

It is by far THE most disappointing, flat out disgusting sushi I have ever eaten. 

I was in town for a couple of weeks, and had dinner from here twice. Both times it made me sick. Literally. 

You are better off dousing your shoe insole in soy sauce and dining on that, than eating anything from here. Safer, too.",1
"ive gotten food poisoning from this place, found hair in the garlic bread, and felt bloated/nauseous after eating here, but i still order it anyway because it&#39;s so damn good.",1
"I have to reduce the number of stars to 3. I&#39;ve had some amazing meals at this place, but it&#39;s really lacking in consistency. Last night, I ordered delivery, specifying that everything needed to be vegan. They said it would be fine and, given that they have such a focus on ingredients, I thought it would be. It&#39;s not hard to do pad thai without egg -- or is it? Apparently, it&#39;s harder than I thought. The rest of the food wasn&#39;t so great, either. Even my perennially non-complaining boyfriend mentioned it as soon as our guest left.  The spring rolls, which used to be hot, juicy and delicious with mushroom flavor, are now overly noodly and not very flavorful. The green curry has also gone all boring and standard.

Not sure what is going on. Maybe the head chef is sick or maybe they just suck at delivery. Who knows? I&#39;ll try again in a few weeks to see if it&#39;s good again. It used to be SO good!",0
"this place have 4 star on Yelp!? Really?! Has Yelp&#39;s standard gotten that low? 

My second visit here wasn&#39;t so pleasant and I got food poisoning after eating here! NEVER AGAIN!

First of all, the Sapporo beer we got was flat, warm, and tasted nasty! I know and love my Sapporo and it shouldn&#39;t have tasted like that! 

We had the fish poki, which was made with &#34;fresh&#34; fish and white onion. It tasted decent when I was eating it, but I don&#39;t think the fish was &#34;fresh&#34; at all 

For ramen we had the vegetable ramen, which on the menu said &#34;made with LOTS of vegetable&#34; but when we got it, there was not much vegetables at all. It tasted just ok, and was a bit on the salty side

We also had the chicken soup ramen, which was the WORST ramen I had ever tasted. The soup had  an old, nasty chicken taste to it, yuck! 

I don&#39;t know what gave me GI problem, whether it was the &#34;fresh&#34; fish or the nasty chicken ramen...whatever it is, I will not be returning again!",1
"Annoying yuppie weirdos in the day time who are socially akward. Better crowd at night time. Horrible music. At least play top 40, not swing from the 50&#39;s. Burgers were good. Three friends got food poisoning and threw up from the chicken Panini so you probably shouldn&#39;t get it. It is a shame too because the place is nice and has good potential.",1
"1.  Sanitary is what pops into my mind.  I&#39;ve seen a big cockroach run across the floor, and water dripping from the ac vent onto people.

2.  Sure the food is tasty and plentiful, but at what price?  I did not get food poisoning eating here, but they need to step up the clean factor.",0
I use to eat here all of the time no issues.  In the last 6 mos or maybe a little more every time I order a steak dish like 3rd ave or something similar I get sick.  First time I thought was a fluke.  Ordered the same this week and got sick as a dog.  My friend gets the pizza or quesadillas and got sick both times from the cheese.  I really hope they go back to the way they were.  Please please if you changed food vendors go back to them.,1
"I gave this place a second chance ... and it was worse than the first time. My egg cream was thick and sickening to drink. I walked out without drinking more than a couple of sips. My husband ordered a burger ... and wasn&#39;t given any condiments to eat his fries with. The waiter kept disappearing for lengths of time, and never checked in on us. And we were eating there at MIDNIGHT. The place was practically empty! The waiter also had a difficult time understanding that I wanted an open-faced sandwich. He kept trying to get me to order it as a full sandwich because &#34;it cost the same&#34;. If I was worried about cost I would have ordered a cheaper item, not ask for less bread.

And to top it all, the waiter made a mistake in adding up our bill, and then was hassling me as I was trying to double check his math to make sure everything was in order.

I AM NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN.

P.S. The only reason why I went to Happy Days is because Custom House across the street stopped serving food that late.",0
"I&#39;m not a big fan, but definitely a must try if you&#39;re visiting the city.  The pastrami on rye seems to be the most popular item on the menu and definitely fills you up.  It&#39;s definitely tasty, however I do feel a bit sick after eating it (just soo filling).  

Staff is not too friendly, but they&#39;re efficient.  I&#39;ve only come here after a night of drinking so the crowd is usually the after-hours drunk crowd, which can be a bit annoying. 

This place is definitely not cheap, but most people come here knowing that.  

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back again, but probably not by my own choice.",0
"Ehh. Sadly this meal resulted in me being sick the rest of the night and the following day. Came here with friends after a few drinks and they didn&#39;t want to walk the extra three blocks to a really great Mexican place I was recommending. So, we ended up here. I knew walking in what sort of quality food we&#39;d be eating, and sadly, that lack of authenticity held true.",1
"I was going to catch a bus to Boston on Sunday, and I wanted to get something to fortify myself for the 5 hour drive. Remembering my college years I chose to go to Au Bon Pain. I bought hot Chicken Sandwich (number 84 I believe). The service was a bit slow, but people working there were nice enough. 

Once on a bus, I dug into the sandwich, which tasted pretty good. I manage to handle only  1/2, so I decided to leave the other half for later. It tasted just fine. After about 1-2 hours I began to feel tell tale signs of food poisoning. Increased temperature, perspiration, nausea. &#34;Oh, no!&#34; I have thought, maybe it is nothing, so I decided to sleep it off. I woke up with the taste that something had died in my mouth. 

Imagine a sandwich that had been laying in hot weather outside, it is rotten, but not in a &#34;growing my own colony&#34; type of rotted, but proteins of the chicken had been denatured, type of rotten. Imagine how that would smell, now that is how the after taste felt.  So I am sitting there, with the taste of something foul in my mouth, and hoping that I can make it to the bus terminal before the sandwich goes back up. I did make it, and the rest of the food from Au Bon Pain went straight to the bin.

Now I am sitting at work, feeling miserable. Disgruntled enough to want to write a review.

TL:DR: Sandwich from Au Bon Pain gave me food poisoning. Stay away.",1
"I ended up terribly sick from the food here.  With reviews and recommendations from yelpers and friends, I expected some decent quality.  The ambiance, when first walking in, was rather impressive.  It&#39;s a place I&#39;d take a date to, but... I probably wouldn&#39;t come back... ever.  It&#39;s not simply because I got sick, but I was insulted by the staff here when I told them that the sashimi I ordered was not edible.

I ordered an order of yellow tail and albacore, skipping the rice because, well... that&#39;s how you should judge a sushi joint (not on hand-rolls).  The yellow-tail wasn&#39;t exactly top grade but edible with some hints of several thaws (having a dry texture due to water evap).  I didn&#39;t complain.  Then doom came. With the albacore, the instant it touched my tongue, the rancid fish oils came through along with an un-surprisingly DRY texture. I spit out what I could, then after a while, I had to call upon a waiter to share my concern.  You could smell the degradation from both pieces!

I simply told the waiter... &#34;the albacore is not... on par to be served&#34;.  He politely told me he&#39;d see whats wrong with it and took it to the back.  When he came back, he said &#34;We had just opened the package yesterday.  Perhaps albacore does not suit your tastes.&#34;  HEY buddy. I LOVE and KNOW my albacore. I definitely know what you were implying also! A$$hat.

On my ride to the subway, i felt like the water was boiling over in my stomach. Once I made it home... the toilet was my salvation for an hour.  Take it for what it is, but, this is one place I have to go against the yelpers here.  It&#39;s one bad case, sure, but do you really want to risk it?  Enjoy the rolls and pan-seared edemames (which were delicious) if it&#39;s your thing.  But for me, I don&#39;t go to a sushi joint for those things.


An additional star was added simply because the ambiance, appetizers, and services were good.",1
"I recently went to an event at Barclays with some friends and walked out starving.  Most of the Park Slope restaurants are closed by 11:30.  I&#39;d been to 200 5th a few years ago and it was solid.  Good beer selection, solid bar food.  

The recent experience was nothing like the past ones.  First round of beers comes, one is skunked.  It happens, I think nothing of it.  Waitress is totally cool with letting a change happen.  Different beer comes, it&#39;s skunked again!  

Honey wings, very good.  Since I can&#39;t give this experience 0 stars, the honey wings are reason for a star.  

The entrees ordered should have been layups.  Burger, turkey burger and grilled cheese.  It&#39;s not like we ordered the fish and chicken cordon bleu.  I ate the burger because I&#39;m a dude and I was starving, but I was praying for no food poisoning when I got home.  The meat tasted old.  The bun was dry and tasteless.  It was so horrible that I removed the burger/cheese/veggies and ate it separately.  I should have sent everything back but at this point it would have been a pointless exercise.  I just needed to get out of there.

The curly fries were average, not bad.  Friend got onion rings on the side, decent also.   

I&#39;m disappointed by experience here.  It&#39;s a great setup for a game.  I&#39;d say if you are going here get the wings and beer on bottle to keep it simple and safe.",0
"I haven&#39;t been on Yelp in ages, but I felt it was worth the time to give Foragers a 2-star review. I&#39;ve started buying lunch here since a co-worker recently got food poisoning from another nearby deli (Jimmy&#39;s) that I used to visit frequently. Never again.

Rational behind my rating:

1. Foragers is ridiculously over priced. Even for NYC standards, Foragers prices on produce are ridiculous and the quality is average at best. For example, there were cherries at $10/lb!  The meat section is similarly overpriced

2. There are flies everywhere. I saw dozens of flies on all of the fresh produce, as well as on the salad bar food items. How hard it it to buy some lids for the food items? This is a health-safety issue, so sorry, no excuses. Next time I will post pictures.  

The only thing that saves them from a 1-star review is their staff seems friendly and fairly efficient.",0
We had high school reunion last Friday. 3 of us had serious diarrhea and I caught fever. The food is obviously not fresh. Don&#39;t go and save yourself some troubles!!!!!,1
"We attended a birthday party here. Great party but food was ehhhhhh.

We had the fried chicken lollipop appetizer. I honestly thought I was going to get sick from eating it. It had that nasty uncooked chicken flavor. The chicken tikka was decent. For dinner the General Tso&#39;s chicken sucked. 

Go to Taipan to have some hookah, but avoid the food. It is not good.",0
"We had company over to watch baseball and decided to order from the Chicken Shack. HUGE mistake. First, the food was just mediocre. I found the chicken to be ok, but somewhat dry. The sides varied from just ok to gross. The mashed potatoes and lemon potatoes were decent, but the veggies were just cold blanched veggies with no flavor. The mac and cheese was disgusting! It was orange macaroni ala Kraft, rather than the home cooked cheesy variety I expected from a restaurant. It also had no flavor! Kraft is better than this. When you have one bite and don&#39;t want anymore, you know it&#39;s a bad side dish. STAY AWAY FROM THE MAC AND CHEESE! My boyfriend didn&#39;t let us get the fries because he said he&#39;s had them before and they are pretty bad.

So here&#39;s the worst part: we all got food poisoning afterwards! There were 5 of us eating, and this was the only thing we all ate together. My boyfriend was the worst off and missed a full day of work. Chirping Chicken is just not worth your time or money.",1
"I have eaten here probably 100+ times, because I work across the street and it is so convenient. But after my 7th or 8th bout of  mild food poisoning (no joke), I think it&#39;s time I called it quits. Basically, anything that hasn&#39;t been made within the previous 5 minutes has had enough bacteria grow on it due to being prepared in unsanitary conditions that it&#39;ll make you sick. You can expect that from any open salad/chinese food bar, so eating from Cafe Duke&#39;s salad bar would be your fault. But the sushi served here is the lowest quality served in the city, which is saying a lot, and I have twice seen someone mop the floors and then prepare sandwiches for delivery without washing their hands. The worst part? The terrible attitude of the people that work there, particularly the night manager. 

These guys will be in business forever because they are smart enough to take up space on a block next to law firms, investment banks and other businesses where people try and find the fastest food possible, without regard to cost. That&#39;s why they are able to have whole aisles of super-overpriced &#34;health bars&#34; and granola-nonsense (up to $6+ a granola bar!) just because they know that most of the people who walk in here are getting their meal paid for by their employer/client. I am just waiting for the day when the health inspector comes through and sweeps these guys away so that a half-decent deli can take their place. Wishful thinking..",1
"When I first heard the words &#34;Irish Bar&#34; I was a bit hesitant to oblige but upon entering Session House, I was immediately taken by the laidback and warm atmosphere. For a late Saturday night, it wasn&#39;t as disgustingly crowded as the bar next door and everyone seemed to be enjoying their own groups. Live music played in the background and everything seemed to just read &#34;chill&#34;. 

We ordered the Irish Steak and Guinness Pie and although this was my first time here, my sister, who I was eating with, noted that it was much more sour than it usually was. After a few minutes of debating whether or not to send it back, we asked the waitress whether or not it was supposed to be sour. Nothing ruins a great night like a bout of food poisoning. The waitress was extremely accommodating. She said she would ask the chef about what was going on with the pie and informed us that there&#39;s usually a bit of vinegar that gets added at the end and we may have just gotten a particularly sour batch. After confirming that it wasn&#39;t a matter of food gone bad, the waitress offered to switch out our pie with a new one or something different and was very apologetic even though it didn&#39;t seem to be hers or anyone&#39;s fault. We stuck with our pie but found it a nice gesture that she was so willing to help. All in all, a great night at a great bar.",0
Two Words: Food Poisoning.,1
Went here for a friends birthday with the promise that it had amazing food. I&#39;m not a fan of BBQ but she said there was non bbq things to eat. Well this place is SO memorable!!!! Two hours later it gave me my very first case of food poisoning!!! Never in my life have i ever been so sick. i thought i was DYING. Dying actually would have been preferable to food poisoning. It&#39;s not like i could have just gone home either. I live on Long Island so i had my boyfriend get a cab to take us to Penn Station where the food poisoning hit full force. Thankfully there was a Rite Aide where i was able to obtain a bottle of pepto to chug. 3 days later i felt better but i can tell you i will NEVER EVER E V E R go back to that place. The food wasn&#39;t even that great. not worth the food poisoning.,1
"This restaurant is always on Savored, so husband and decided to finally give it a try.  We walked in and saw the garden room in the back and asked to sit there.  They led us out there but the tables might as well have been picnic tables and it was hot, so we went back into the main retaurant.  

It was pretty warm in the main restaurant as well, but we&#39;re here so let&#39;s just drink water and hopefully cool down.

The waiter brought over room temperature water, sans ice cubes.  Warm tap water, just what I want to drink on this hot Summer day in your non air conditioned restaurant.  

Why we did not leave at this point, I will always wonder...

We ordered the clams casino, a ceasar salad, pasta e fagioli, and decided to share the salmon entree.

Clams casino- literally just warmed clams with break crumbs poured on top.
Pasta E Fagioli- No.. just no.
Ceasar Salad- I&#39;ve had better on an airplane
Salmon entree- husband was too grossed out from the apps to eat much of it.  I was too put off by the restaurant at this point to trust the rare portion so I just ate the more well done crusts.

As we walked out my husband was convinced he had food poisoning.  I was just happy that we never suggested it for a group of friends, as we do suggest Savored restaurants all the time and I would NEVER hear the end of it.

Never going back.",0
"I&#39;m picky when it comes to Falafel&#39;s, I was not impressed with theirs.  I got a platter for a great price of $6.  It included around 10 falafels, pits, humas, eggplant, and a small salad.

Though they gave a lot of Falafel&#39;s I felt they were over cooked, and humas was too thin.  For sandwich @ $5 and platter $6 it&#39;s kinda worth it however my friend and I both felt sick after eating sandwich and platter.  So we will not be going back anytime soon.",0
"I really want to give this place a three star rating, but I&#39;m pretty sure I got food poisoning from here when I ordered the Lantern&#39;s noodles...

The decor is gorgeous. Very dark and sensual and modern. It&#39;s lit with candles and very dim lighting. The food presentation is also impressive as is the drink presentation (there are paper roses made from straw encasing in the straws when they bring your drink order!). The food was delicious. The service is fairly good. And I would have no complaints and given it four stars. Until the check came... it&#39;s a little pricey for the quality of food. Three stars then! But wait... an hour later, my stomach started a war against the rest of my body. Sorry Lantern, two stars for you.",1
"This was my second lunch here in about 2 weeks. The food is indeed amazingly fresh and healthy, but also very tasty and well beyond the norm. Both times I had salads and the protein content was 100 times better than the usual dry chicken or grilled meat you would get in other places. There is real thought behind the flavors and the ingredients in the food. The focaccia and herb butter that came with my turkey meatloaf salad (yes, that&#39;s right - not dried out turkey slivers but warm chunks of mouth watering homemade-style turkey meatloaf on a bed of super-fresh and yummy greens, with corn, a bit of cheese and a great but not overpowering dressing) was amazing.
It was nearly 100 degrees outside this afternoon. I walked 4 very hot blocks from my office  to get to this place for lunch because honestly it was the only place I would have trusted to provide a meal that wouldn&#39;t give me food poisoning. I ate every bite, and I feel great!",0
"Split 2 pies between 4 people:  the supreme, which was fully loaded and delicious, and the vodka pie.  Perfect amount of food to stuff yourself without making yourself sick.  Both were really good and a little different.  My lasting impression is that squeaky chewy texture of the mozzarella on the vodka pie.  I can almost feel/hear it on my teeth now.  Maybe the best cheese I&#39;ve ever had on a pie.  Maybe I should go for dinner tonight?",0
"I just ate here tonight and 30 minutes later experienced symptoms of food poisoning.  I&#39;ve reported this restaurant to 311.  Curious, I looked up their recent NYC inspection results.  While the grade is pending, they have two critical violations:

Food poisoning aplenty.,1
"Doesn&#39;t take much to please me, I love onions, I love cabbage, I love broccoli &amp; mushrooms so I was pleased with my order from HH.  Yea they give you a lot of cabbage and onions but hey I don&#39;t mind it&#39;s all good! Okay so I got a few crunchy spoonfulls of crunch rice but it was very few, the chicken was good, yum yum sauce was good and the guy on truck was friendly (said thank you and have a good weekend).  What on earth are you expecting from a $10 or less meal??? Aside from the people who got sick I don&#39;t see what all the 1 &amp; 2 star reviews are for.  They have a good decent solid meal at a reasonable price. Half of the people giving low reviews have probably at some point and time cooked up worse stuff in their house and ate it so what gives??  

I&#39;ll be back, I like it.",0
"I think I got food poison from here last night, the prawn shrimp tasted awFUL. The place looks decent, service sucks, people don&#39;t speak English, they bring out the wrong dish, then tell me that the sauce went bad which practically affects all of the dishes. They weren&#39;t clear that it was the sauce went bad, we only thought it was the prawns but they used the same sauce in all of the dish. I would never go there again! Then to top it off, their prices are like through the ceiling for a little place like this. I would recommend Sagar around the corner any day over these guys!",1
"I would give zero if I could. This is the worst Restaurant I have ever been at! 

We only went in to that Taco bell because it was 96 degrees outside and we wanted to get some cool Air. The place we originally wanted to stay at had no AC and basically yelled food poisoning but would have been the better choice.

So, let&#39;s start with the completely depressing, run down look. We where the only customers  on a Saturday afternoon. Most of the tables where really dirty and the chairs had ripped and worn off. 

When I ordered my food, the casher was completely unable to use the register. It took him like 10 minutes to take my order, he got it wrong and charged me more than it was, since he was unable to figure our the lunch-box thing... He then forgot my cup and after I asked for it, he gave me neither a straw nor a lid. 

i ate half of the food that he gave me, then threw it away since i was to afraid to get food poisoning and it tasted like nothing. 

I was so glad to get out of there and swore to myself: never again!",0
"At first I was excited and thought it was a cool low key gem but after eating there I am really not sure what the fuss is all about - the fact its part of a tortilla factory? It took ages for them to prepare the food, when it arrived you couldn&#39;t tell what meat was what and to top it off I got food poisoning yay. I won&#39;t be back",1
"One horrible experience.

For starters, let me say that for me to write a yelp review, says a lot about how disappointed I am with my experience at an establishment. I only have one other yelp review and that is because I am rarely so upset that I feel the need to share my experience with others.

A little background about myself. I have been around restaurants all my life, my father is a well known GM in NYC has worked at several respected establishments, most notably Balthazar. This being said, I am always the one of my group of friends to make plans and handle any situations that arise when dealing with restaurants.

So now that you have a little background, here is what went down. It is my 24th birthday next week and my best friends bday was on 7/18, so we combined parties. I had been to Blockheads before, and I know that they serve quality, inexpensive margaritas in an outdoor setting that I felt would be perfect to pre-game before we got  into the evening. 

We had a large group of people, 18 to be exact, and I knew we needed to get there early, so I made everyone hurry after work to get ready and make an 8 o&#39;clock train so we could get to Blockheads relatively early.  We ended up getting there sometime around 9:30 pm, and it being a clear night out, the place was packed as usual. I spoke with whom I thought was the hostess but turned out to be the manager, Sonya. 

I was informed &#34;It would be an hour wait, however some of your group is too intoxicated to be served alcohol.&#34; 

Now, I am a reasonable person, and as I previously mentioned, I have been around restaurants all my life. if somebody in my group was intoxicated to the point of not being served, I would have been the first to admit it and if they complained or made a scene, I would told them they are out of luck and should have been more responsible about what they drank. This however was not the case. Not a single person in my group of 18 was drowsy, loud, obnoxious, unbalanced, sick, slurring or any of the other ques that would be used to determine they are&#34;too drunk&#34;. 

I spoke with Sonya for several more minutes, attempting to persuade her to change her mind and asking her to tell me what she used to determine they were too drink and who exactly they were in our group, neither of which she would answer. 

To my dismay, we made no progress. I took her name and the owners contact information and left dissatisfied. At this point everyone&#39;s buzz that we had worked up on our train ride in was subsiding and people were getting anxious and hungry. So, we decided to go across the court yard and get a bite to eat instead.

Before I was even able to open my mouth to address the host, I was told &#34;I&#39;m sorry sir, we&#39;ve been informed by the other restaurant that some of your group are too intoxicated, and we are unable to server you.&#34;

So we left. Hungry, sober and pretty pissed off. Thank you Blockheads for putting a damper on the rest of the night.

We walked over to the second location that I had planned for the night, The Press Lounge, which is a much more classy, roof-top bar. All 18 people got in without as much as a second glance from the bouncer. After about an hour, we went down town to the Sullivan room, which again, after continuing to drink for another hour, all 18 people got in without issue. 

I will not be returning to any of the Blockheads establishments, and plan to turn anyone away who mentions that name.

For you Yelp readers, just know that going here will be a roulette of whether or not you get in.",0
"Hooray! CBTL made the jump to NYC! It&#39;s a nice trip down memory lane for me in my LA days, and I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ve got one here to rely on. 

There&#39;s free wifi and lots of tables to set up and work/sit and talk over a bomb.com Chai anything or an apricot latte (my personal favorite). They also have this like, &#34;fix all&#34; tea bomb drink for when you&#39;re sick that is a little sip of heaven. 

The staff isn&#39;t the greatest, but I&#39;m here for the product. It doesn&#39;t disappoint.",0
"I&#39;m a BIG fan of chicken fingers, but was highly disappointed with this restaurant. I ordered 5 original fingers (I had no idea how much I was getting) and some of the Idaho truffle fries to share with my sister. I ate 2 fingers and was pretty sick for the remainder of that night and the next morning. The chicken part was fresh- but it was so fried it was disgusting. Also, both the fries and the chicken fingers had WAY too much oregano. And, it was overpriced. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place. I gave this place 2 stars bc the delivery was fairly quick.",0
"After posting my original review, the NYC Health Dept contacted me and urged me to call 311 to report the food poisoning incident at Atlas Cafe.  I would like to clarify I did not contract food poisoning from Atlas Cafe.  I merely likened the urgency to post my one star review of Atlas to my urgency to use the bathroom when I did contract food poisoning from a wedding in Jersey.",0
"My friend and I were craving Thai last night, and hoping to sit outside since the hot summer weather had cooled down for the night, thanks to a nice light rain. The rain cleared, and we asked the waitress if we could sit on the patio. They opened it up for us, which was much appreciated.

We ordered a sampler of appetizers and side dishes. Had the papaya salad, steamed dumplings, summer rolls, eggplant, and duck wrap. Paired them with a frozen thai iced tea. Must say, the food was delicious. I liked everything I tasted, especially the eggplant.

I got food poisoning. My friend did not. I&#39;m thinking that it&#39;s because I ate most of the eggplant, but one cannot be sure. All I know is that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to convince myself to go back any time soon.",1
"Hit and miss but when it misses - look out! I ate the mackerel sushi and got food poisoning. However, I blame myself for that as much as I blame them. It&#39;s cheap sushi, people. Having lived in Japan, there&#39;s cheap sushi there, too, and although it&#39;s not nearly as likely to give you projectile vomiting and diarrhea (fresher in general), you still get what you pay for.

If you&#39;re looking for cooked food (tempura, negimaki, tonkatsu, etc.), it&#39;s just okay. It&#39;s edible, little more.

If you&#39;re looking for raw sushi, you must know what you&#39;re getting into. The shallow end of the pool (spicy tuna rolls, spicy salmon, things like that) is safe, but if you&#39;re going to order a la carte, you&#39;d better know your stuff. The sniff test is key and if you don&#39;t know what to sniff for, just get a california roll and call it a night.

I still order from there, but I almost always go for safe bets and cooked sushi (the eel is actually quite good).",1
"Gave them another chance - no more, no more.  I went with a friend last night at around 9 PM.  We were the only customers.  Fried rice was stale and old.  Hot mustard tasted suspiciously like Grey Poupon.  Tea was lukewarm.  Service verged on hostile.

Have a nice little touch of food poisoning today, too.  I blame the rice - that shit had to have been sitting there for at least 3 hours.

The employees there don&#39;t care about the customers or the quality of their food.  Don&#39;t give them your money.  Go to Green Leaves or Shanghai Lee instead.  Better food, better prices, nicer employees, and less gastrointestinal distress.

Any Chinese restaurant that can&#39;t do fried rice and tea... if that&#39;s not a red flag, I don&#39;t know what is.  Chinese Musician just sucks.",1
"thank god i dragged some friends here last week -- if I had to go to Elsa again I think i might vomit

not really sure what they&#39;re doing with the light fixtures here but suffice to say they&#39;re probably &#34;salvaged&#34; and &#34;artisanal&#34; -- either way the soft lighting makes this place sexy as hell 

atmosphere is buzzin with chill but fluid tunes and the drink ingredients are a little edgier than elsewhere (RED BELL PEPPER - WUT?) people were dressed classy but the setting made it approachable. i&#39;d definitely come back here.",0
"This was a great surprise so far west. We had the deviled eggs, beet salad, and a 6 cheese plate. The service was great when you could find a server. Our main issue was locating a server - there seemed to be 2 servers for both the inside and outside patrons. Perhaps someone called in sick but we were always wanting more water and had to wait quite a while before we could ask for more bread. It was also a bit uncomfortably warm. The bar was nowhere near full of people and we loved the atmosphere but we actually wanted to leave because it was so warm inside. The cheese plate was great and well presented. The food was all on point if a touch pricey. Good food, great service when you could find a server, please turn on the AC.

I&#39;m definitely willing to give it another shot and see if they were just short a server (who controls the AC) that night.",0
"Had the most insanely shitty experience here last weekend-no lie. Came here for brunch with high hopes. Most of the other reviews seem pretty decent and the really bad one&#39;s seem to be older. There was a big group of us that were celebrating my going away, so we sat outside for the time. We had to ask for everything. Water, cuttlery, menus. 

It took them over a half an hour to bring out some coffee, an hour into brunch the waitress comes back and tells him she completely forgot to put in his order. An hour and a half in he finally gets served. My other friend NEVER got the water she asked for. My other lady friend was going to order something but decided not after overhearing that old girl forgot to put in his order. I had the catfish and grits. It was okay. Though the consistency of the grits was like glue. I put some hot sauce on it and made it work. My friend didn&#39;t like her blueberry pancakes and swears she got sick off of them. But who knows? Maybe it was the overly spicy bloody mary she had?

By the time the check comes there are only four of us that are still waiting to pay, as everyone else has already settled their check. It comes on one big check with the gratuity added FOR SIX PEOPLE! Why was gratuity added for six people when only four of us were splitting the check. I go to discuss this and get the check split. It&#39;s like pulling teeth to get it done. Then my friend walks up to the bar where I am standing and I say something to her about the service and overall experience and the girl turns around, butts in and starts picking a fight, ABOUT SOMETHING I AM SAYING TO MY FRIEND! I understand it&#39;s just a restaurant but I too work in food service and I believe a certain level of professionalism should prevail regardless of the type of establishment it is. There was absolutely no reason for her to get involved in my conversation. She was at work, she should have been focused on doing her job. And  I gave a friend some of my mimosa and it automatically turned into a 6 dollar drink. I find it odd that the waitress was able to see/remember this, but couldn&#39;t remember to put in my friends order or to bring the table coffee and water. Will not go back, will not recommend, and will bad mouth to anyone who even LOOKS like they might be interested in hearing about it.",1
"SIGNAL BOOST! 
I&#39;ve posted before and said I really like Mizumi but today, one of the worst things happened. My friend got food poisoning on the spot after eating 1 plate at mizumi and had to go straight to the bathroom to vomit! After eating 1 plate of sushi, she felt really sick and said the fish tasted off then left the table.
(FYI: She didn&#39;t have any breakfast before (We met for lunch) nor did she eat any dinner the night before so there is no other food to blame at this point. Also she eats sushi regularly)
I later tried the fish and it was really off and not fresh. We called the waiter over who couldn&#39;t understand us well and we brought the attention over to the staff without being rude about it but we also told htem it was unacceptable for them to serve such food without carefully inspecting it. The worst part? All we got was a fake &#34;sorry&#34; and she was still required to pay full price even though she barely finished the 1 plate that gave her food poisoning. 

For fish to be that un-fresh and served to so many customers per day and for her to get that SICK after eating it so quickly, this says so many wrong things about how they handle their seafood quality.

Also checked their cocktail shrimp, they were NOT deveined and today the seafood just seemed really not as fresh as I remembered. What a horrible day for my friend!!!
This is my 5th time here and will certainly be my last.",1
"NOT GLUTEN FREE!!! BE AWARE!

I ordered from this place twice. The same Gluten Free Pizza looked very differently the second time. However, the price for two was the same. First time, my pizza was delicious, but I suspect it wasn&#39;t Gluten Free.  I was sick with my usual Gluten symptoms for two days after it.  Second time, the Gluten Free Pizza  looked very different from the previous one and both of us got severe stomach pains and nausea about an hour after we ate it. I looked half  burnt outside and undercooked  almost sour dough inside.. Also I have no idea what kind of dough it was, but definitely not Gluten Free. Very bad quality. If you don&#39;t want suffer from severe stomach pains, don&#39;t order from here.",0
"It&#39;s decent cheap American-Chinese food.  I don&#39;t understand the negative reviews.  Also they have an A health code rating, which 2 of the local competitors do not.  At least I know I&#39;m not going to get sick after eating here.  They are very nice people too.",0
"The food is tasty and cheap, and my husband still prefers it to the other Chinese places nearby but I got sick after eating here once and their health code rating is a B.
I had the house special duck which im assuming probably isnt one of the more popular items and so may have been old.  I have also seen the way they pre-cooked meat and then just quickly reheat it for orders.  Some meat containing items were not refrigerated.

Go to Lee&#39;s or Oriental House instead.  Both have A health code ratings.",1
Food poisoning from the Scallops.  Never again.  Service was fine.  Food was mediocre.  Food poisoning really sucks.,1
"Came here for uncle&#39;s birthday. To date, this was my worst nyc dining experience (and I&#39;ve been here for 20+ years). Out of a group of 25, 16 people got food poisoning within 1-2 days. My whole family tested positive for Norovirus. I want back to speak with the owner about the incident and he had the nerve to not even acknowledge that the food poisoning happened at his restaurant. As if 16 people eating together the day before and all getting sick was some sort of coincidence!!! Checked Yelp over the next week, and surprise, surprise, more people with food poisoning (not even members of our party). Horrible, disguisting food and even worse attitude. I hope this place gets shut down by the city.",1
"At some point on St Patty&#39;s, after stumbling around from Woodside and down Skillman Ave, my friends and I continued to stumble all the way into Bar 43.  It was starting to get late in the day, and as such, it was time to order some food.  Nobody was in the mood for full dinners, so we ordered some apps, a plate of fries, some mozzarella sticks, and wings.

Bar 43 has some interesting names for their wings, relating to how spicy they are.  I would recommend that you exercise some caution here.  The people who eat the spiciest food in our groups, the Jamaican hot peppers and African shrimp had a hard time with the abusive wings.  And that isn&#39;t even the hottest available, or the second hottest.   These really need to be called Chris Brown wings for people to get the point.  I can&#39;t imagine what the Nuclear and Suicidal wings are like. 

So, after discovering this place, my girlfriend and I decided to come back.  There are many choices for burgers infused with Guiness, and as I had thought, anything with Guiness simply tastes that much better.  If you&#39;re not interested in that, the menu has decent variety with some great creativity.  I would highly recommend, especially if you&#39;re getting sick of Manhattan prices for the same items.",0
"Yes the pizza is great! BUT its not gluten free! Hello, gluten free is not just a fad for those people who don&#39;t understand what it is and maybe think they will shed a few pounds.  Its a severe allergy! I ate this pizza and within an hour was so sick.  They responded by saying that they are not able to make it a controlled gluten free environment and so contamination is possible.  Ok so lets put that on the menu with a giant note, please.",0
"The owners may think changing the name of the restaurant is a good way to escape their horrible reviews, but it is not. Dined here last spring, when it was already &#34;Tzar&#34;. Copying from my review posted for &#34;New York Steakhouse&#34;.

"This used to be a consistently excellent midtown lunch spot for celebratory work lunches. I think the wheels have started to fall off the bus. My Louisiana shrimp salad had two rotten, grey shrimp in it that tasted like dead fish (I unfortunately bit in to a piece of it without realizing it was discolored due to the amount of dressing it was doused in let&#39;s see if this will involve food poisoning too). The service was horrible in the caf?. We waited 20 minutes for our orders to be taken and the food came out very slowly. I think at this price point both in the dining room and caf?, service should be nothing less than attentive and top notch.",0
"second visit at Fat Buddha and me and my friend got food poisoning. 

we had the soy buns, fried chicken wings, and the salt and pepper squid. 

Don&#39;t know which dish gave us food poisoning but my friend was vomiting non-stop the next day and i was having the runs. 

No more Fat Buddha for me!",1
"Sure, the drinks were good. 
sure the music was fun. 
BUT..... Food poisoning is no freaking joke.  
cleanliness and fresh food should be number one...no???

My friend and I had 1-2 drinks each at Fat Buddah, along with a few dishes. 
I didn&#39;t ingest anything much after eating dinner there

We were both fine the night of, however I almost couldn&#39;t make it to work the next day because I was feeling so nauseous and kept throwing up. My friend was also experiencing painful stomach symptoms the next day.  I&#39;ve been in NYC for 5 years and I&#39;ve never encountered any food poisoning situations with local restaurants. 

this was my first trip to Fat Buddah,  can safely say it will be my last.",1
"If you want bad food, glacial service and Pepto Bismol for dessert, then Beach Cafe is your answer.  Seriously, how is this place even open?  I don&#39;t blame the servers, I blame the kitchen that clearly never took a cooking class.  Call me crazy, but I like my food cooked in the middle, and not icy cold, and when I order tortellini with peas and mushrooms, I&#39;d like those peas and mushrooms to not be invisible.  And, no, bringing them to me after I call out the mistake is not acceptable.  Just sayin&#39;.

Follow up to my post-I was up all night with food poisoning.  Experiencing that poor excuse for a dinner, in the most disgusting way, at 3am was not my idea of fun.",1
"I have been a big fan of Aroma.

I was horrified.  Seriously, I didn&#39;t even know restaurants are allowed to do business with that poor of health code performance!  I am so glad we made it out without food poisoning!  I will not be back until they are rated an &#34;A&#34; again, though I will now always doubt whether they are regularly clean.",0
"It cracks me up, the reviewers on here talking about getting snobby service at this place; get real! Mr.Chow isn&#39;t like sharing a burger and fries with the girl next door at your local diner, it&#39;s a wild night out in Manhattan with a supermodel who hates you, and is only being seen with you because you drive a cool car. Mr.Chow is out of your league! Unless you have the cash to strut through those doors like an absolute Boss, don&#39;t complain about anything, because Mr.Chow isn&#39;t here to make you feel special. The whole scene in here is obnoxious and wasteful, and it makes me sick. But the food is UN. BELIEEEEEEEVABLE. Holy China!

Expect to be knocked out by the flavors going on here! Anyone who says this food is no good is immediately crossed off my list of people who know what they&#39;re talking about. Oh, it&#39;s bland? You&#39;ve had better? How? Is your mother an Iron Chef?",0
"My two friends and I went to the Mezcal&#39;s in Bay Ridge.  The food was fine, service was fine, the singer was annoying as hell to me, and we also dealt with an annoying drunk person next to us.  I got over the singer and the drunk.  We were in a good mood.  Another waiter wrote our check.  My friend was checking  the bill and noticed a service fee for about $17.85.  We asked our original waiter what is this for he, said that they add tips to checks over $100 dollars.  That rule is not printed on menu.  Basically that waiter decided to back up his racist co-worker.  Our check for 3 of was under $100.  I decided to ask the white family of 4, next to us to see their check, it was over $100 and no service fee was added.  Their waiter claimed he was busy and he knew them.    We showed the family our check and they were as shocked as we were.  The ignorant, racist, theft, waiter quickly took back the check and wrote a new one.   Racism is alive and real at Mezcal&#39;s  in Bay Ridge.  He decided that three well educated African Americans were not going to tip.  He makes me sick.   I suggest if you go there double check your  bill the waiter may decide that too don&#39;t know about tipping.  We decided not to tip and reward their racist ways.   By the way I asked for a manger and they claimed one was not there.",0
"Oh my!  The pizza here is amazing.  I got a small Chicken w/Bacon &amp; Chipotle Peppers Pizza, and it was one of the best I&#39;ve had in quite some time.  It&#39;s a bit hot (spicey) but not too bad.  It filled me up, but I didn&#39;t feel sick (like i usually do after pizza).  You also get a free can of soda with your order, but the price in general is pretty decent.

Service is great, they are very friendly here.  The only thing preventing it from a 5 Star place, was seating is a bit cramped and awkward, but I guess it is a pizza shop..

Overall, a very pleasant experience.",0
"Delivery the night before: prompt, early and the assembly was well-put-together and COLD! In the morning, I would begin the FOUNDATION cleanse (dun dun dun)!

Day One: It wasn&#39;t terrible because I knew I had things to keep me busy. However, around 3-4 o&#39;clock I crashed and I had to nap. The night didn&#39;t really get any easier because I had to drink the BPC&#39;s rendition of the &#34;master cleanse&#34; drink twice. I have the nut allergy, so I didn&#39;t get to try the much-raved-about cashew drink. I actually loathe this drink because I can feel my teeth rotting from the sweetness (sigh). The cleanse must go on...

The night was dreadful because my dog got sick, so I was up throughout the night cleaning up vomit and errrrrrr...... other things. Trust me, it didn&#39;t make me crave waffles and ice cream, but now I was tired and hungry.

Day Two: Harder than day one! I tried to avoid walking around the city as much as possible because I wanted to snatch food from every person that walked by me eating, and even the street meat carts made me salivate. Walking by a Mexican restaurant I was tempted to just snap a chip off this group&#39;s table and dip it in their guacamole. But hey I get it, the cleanse is all about self-will and self-control. Needless to say, no Mexican for me. I was going home to drink a delicious green juice. I do enjoy the green juice and the pineapple mint janx. Now that is what I look forward to tomorrow.

Day Three: I had to go to work on the airplane today (12 hours on the plane), but first I had to muster up the courage to enter Penn Station to get to work. Everyone and their mother was headed to the Hamptons (at 7:00 in the morning WTF??)  and I avoided the Starbucks in Penn knowing that my green little juice friend would be consumed on the LIRR. The train headed to the airport was crowded with all the WASPS with whales on their shorts, popped collars and Tory Burch bags. And one of them sitting across from me was eating their smoked salmon on a cream cheese bagel. Jerk! I&#39;m a huge fan of breakfast, but what I noticed was a hyper sensitivity to smell. I think I could smell the cold Alaskan waters that fish had been swimming in! I know this review is over clad with details but whilst &#34;cleansing,&#34; I felt like sight, smell and sounds were amplified. I won&#39;t even get into my day at work, but I did feel like a flight attendant that had given up a nicotine addiction cold turkey. I did look forward to cracking a juice open every hour and a half or two, all packed nicely in my BPC cooler with their sweet little ice packs!",0
"Both my bf and I had this bookmarked on Yelp and he brought it up after a brutal game of mini golf at Pier 25 (Dinner on him!). It was a Saturday evening and the restaurant had ample tables open with only a few patrons. We were quickly seated and ordered:

- the pork belly buns: Very solid! $9 for 2 buns. I loved the miso mayo sauce they used in it which made it taste different from the ones I have tried. Gotta try the the short ribs next time!
- daily selection of sashimi: I was very surprised to find out that I liked every piece of fish on the plate, even the mackerel! We asked our waitress what was what and she came back three times from the sushi bar just to correct herself and give us the correct identifications. It was very nice of her.
- tonkotsu ramen: The bf ordered this and he enjoyed it, commenting on how flavorful and balanced it was.
- parma-karma ramen: Rosemary is a keyword for it. I watched the waitress throw a heap load of parmesan on it (I like things extra cheesy). It was definitely different from any ramen I have had before with the subtle tones of rosemary in the broth. At this point, I was already stuffed and had to take more than half of it home. It still was delish the day after!
- brioche bread pudding: Amazing! Loved the crispy texture of this with the vanilla ice cream.

Still not quite as good as Totto but eating here was very pleasant and satisfying, if you are sick of the usual ramen in NYC, with good service.",0
"Came here for dinner the day after my birthday. We had cancelled all our hard obtained restaurant week reservations from the week including Ai Fiori, Fish Tag, and Telepan--because it was a electrolytes &amp; bland simple carbs week for our tummies. Boyfriend and I had been feeling under the weather all week (yes, in July) so Sul Long Tang was just what we wanted, to sweat it all out.

Not sure why the sanitation rating had been lowered to a C. Maybe because only very sick food poisoned people crave this food. Wes pointed out the sign but since there was no wait to get seated we decided to go for it anyway.

The exorbitant prices are baffling. The cheapest item on the menu was the oxtail bone broth we wanted - $15. Service was slow. They took away our scallions immediately, after we&#39;d added a couple spoonfuls to our bowls. :( Why?!?

The kimchi was amazing though. But we knew that coming in. This will always be a perfect default &#34;sick food&#34; option though, because you really only need/want bland 3-star food when you have rumbly tummies and a sore throat.",0
"Totally overrated, waited about an hour for a table. We had the mussels (bland and my friend said the freshness was questionable and as much as i love food poisoning, no thanks) the gnocchi (couldn&#39;t finish it, it had this odd bitter taste) and the flan (the best thing we had there and thats not really an italian dessert)You&#39;re also forced to listen to other guests conversations since they are basically sitting on your lap... However, prices are decent...",0
"I used to live by the UES location (63rd and 3rd) and I am so sad i am no longer close by... I fell in love with Juice Press there. The staff was always friendly and accomodating, and I never had a problem with freshness... not to mention their kale chips are OUT OF THIS WORLD!! 

Now that I live downtown Im stuck going to this location and boy is it a world of difference. 
- The staff has no idea what is in the food... so dont bother asking about ingredients. 

- I have received sour/spoiled green juice TWICE and they did not give me a refund b/c I didnt have a receipt.. um hello... im there nearly every day and its not like I could have bought it somewhere else!  ( i told them to throw it away and leeft without it) I seriously got really sick - crazy diherrea from their one juice of the 3 that i bought that was &#34;off&#34; and they did nothing for me... 

- The people behind the counter couldn&#39;t give a crap about you and keeping you waiting... Ive never tried ordering a smoothie but its pretty annoying to watch them literally having a little party behind the counter while you&#39;re standing there waiting to pay $50 for a couple juices and a chunk of chocolate. 

Not only that the kale chips at this location are pretty gross compared to the others- so loaded with onion and garlic powder like shitty garlic bread at a cheap pizza joint.  

Juice Press is typically so amazing, delicious and perfect  but this location  really blows. :( Sorry...",1

"I live across the street from Norma&#39;s I have lived in my house my entire life 20 years. Before there was Norma&#39;s there was a optician almost always empty. But then one day I was walking home from the train and I noticed Norma&#39;s. I wanted to try it out but I was broke. But the next time I walked by I had money and I walked in and bought a coffee. It was okay nothing special I also bought a brownie it was good in texture but not in taste. But I liked it at first I went in every time I walked home from the train. A couple of weeks later I noticed a certain crowd going in a group of people I despise they make me sick to my stomach and I don&#39;t know why I just know I loathe them. And soon I started seeing them all around my home Ridgewood was NO is invaded by hipsters and god do I hate them. They are ruining my home my town and they have the nerve to call Ridgewood their home calling themselves &#34;Ridgewoodites&#34; and opening up their &#34;Ridgewood Markets&#34; This is my home and I want you all gone! And also the Ridgewood theater was horrible I hated that place I celebrated a birthday of mine there when I was a child they took me there against my will worst birthday I have ever had. And now these people are trying to save it I bet you those people aren&#39;t even from Ridgewood if they were they wouldn&#39;t try to save that wretched place. Anyway Norma&#39;s is alright not the best I dislike it mostly for the crowd it attracts and for the vegan treats they serve.

"Holy MSG! I was excited for a new dining option in the neighborhood and I really wanted to like this place. The food was good but not great. However, my husband and I are both sensitive to MSG and were sick for 24 hours after eating here. I should have asked beforehand, but these days so few restaurants use enough MSG to knock me out. If you are not sensitive, it&#39;s worth trying if you are looking for something simple in the neighborhood. However, if you have a problem with MSG, let this be a warning.",0
"Average. Nothing special about them honestly. The food is alright, but I would prefer authentic Mexican Food from a cart or a small restaurant than this place. It&#39;s definitely overrated especially since it&#39;s located in Times Square. I also remember my friend getting really sick last time she came here, and she ended up hurling all of it out once she finished her food. Poor her. I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming back here.",1
"My friends and I have been frequenting the frying pan quite a bit recently and I must admit it has never let us down. 

+Staff is great. Don&#39;t be discouraged by the long lines - they move. 
+Sangria pitchers
+Blue point blueberry ale 
+Buckets of corona
+Burgers are tasty (though a bit too well for my linking)
+Seasoned fries
+Clean bathrooms
+Tons of space - great for larger gatherings of friends
+Sometimes have live music
+Your outside, beer in hand, on a boat with the sun setting on Manhattan. It just doesn&#39;t get better than that.

 The negatives:
I recently celebrated my birthday and two of my friends left because they felt sea sick. It really doesn&#39;t rock that much but I would give your sensitive friends a heads up.
It is also a far walk from the trains, however, it&#39;s how you get to the water so that simply can&#39;t be helped. Neither complaint would cost them a star in my book.",0
"***FOOD POISONING:

I went here for restaurant week with some friends. IMMEDIATELY after the meal me and my friend began to feel very ill and had painful cramping and diarrhea. The next day both of us both had diarrhea, nausea, fevers, and chills. We are both doctors and know the symptoms of food poisoning well. We both consumed the Cesar Salad.

I called the restaurant to report the incident of food poisoning, but the help said the manager was busy and to leave a message. The manager did not call me back. I left another message on the manager&#39;s answering machine and she still did not call me back.

Me and my friend reported the incident to the board of health in NYC and they are going to investigate this restaurant. I would never eat here again and this manager should not have a job. She did not take this seriously and clearly does not care about the health of the customers. I am young and healthy, but people with weakened immune systems could have become seriously ill from this incident.

Do not eat at this place.",1
"To be fair I used to really like this place but it has gone down hill.  I was in on Sunday for brunch with my friend and we were on the first people there.  The bread tasted stale and when I asked for fresh bread the guy gave me an attitude.  Incidentally, the next batch did taste better.  The manager came over and explained everything is baked fresh in the morning. Maybe this is the case but at what time because the toast is like frisbees and the muffins have no flavor.   I think they have someone different making them.

Service was ok.   The place just seems tired now.  The omelet I ordered was fine but the lettuce, which was the side,  tasted funny.  I didn&#39;t think anything  of it but about 12 hours later, not having had anything else, I began to feel really sick.  Really sick.  Chills.  Upset stomach. Fatigue.  I was put out all of Monday.  

The restaurant received an &#34;A&#34; rating by the Board of Health while Gotham Pizza received a &#34;C&#34;.  Which one was I sick from? Not Gotham. 

I will never eat here again.",1
"Come on, Artichoke&#39;s! 

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m one out of like 20 people in this city who AREN&#39;T actually impressed by Artichoke&#39;s. People seem to GLORIFY this chain like it&#39;s God&#39;s after-hours grub gift to NYC, but ... I&#39;ve had much better. I don&#39;t care how drunk I am, I&#39;d rather have a 2 Bros slice of pizza and at least I know what I&#39;m getting myself into.

And by getting myself into ... I mean, I can&#39;t be the only other person in this city who&#39;s gotten sick after a couple of slices here. And, by sick, let&#39;s just say I couldn&#39;t leave the apartment all day following my 4 AM binge eat, at least until maybe 4 or 5 pm, for fear of ACCIDENTALLY SHITTING MYSELF. I&#39;ve had Artichoke&#39;s maybe around a collective 3 or 4 times in their various locations, but for some reason, this one by Meatpacking always seems to make me want to throw myself over the Highline just to make the agonizing stomach pain go away. 

Upside is, I met John Stamos here that night -- er, morning. JOHN STAMOS aka. Uncle Jesse aka. Silver Fox aka. BE MY DADDY aka. I LOVE YOU. Extra star for that.

Random: My friend and I sat next to some Brazilian guys in town and managed to convince them that slapping a Marinara slice and an Artichoke slice together then eating them together like a sandwich was the &#34;NEW YORK&#34; thing to do. When asked why nobody else was eating their pizza the way we were, we told them that they weren&#39;t real New Yorkers. Poor guys.

Anyways... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back for awhile. I still have that churning, nauseuous-clammy feeling in my stomach every time I make eye contact with an Artichoke&#39;s, kind of the same way I feel when think of my tool of an ex-boyfriend. Whoops!

To the rest of you: Good luck, God speed, and God bless your bowel movements.",1
"Let&#39;s start out with the worst part....

I ordered a spinach roll (along with other things), and paid online via credit card for said spinach roll. I didn&#39;t get said spinach roll, and when I called the restaurant back to ask where it was, they refused to pick up the phone. For a solid hour. And I know they were actively avoiding phone calls because every time I called there was a busy signal, meaning they took the phone off the hook, and the second I called when there was none, it would ring for a solid 10 minutes, and then immediately go back to busy signal. 
I don&#39;t understand how any business that wants to retain any sort of clientele would work in such a manner.
I also realized shortly after this, that this Luigi&#39;s is owned by the same mediocre-to-awful Luigi&#39;s that I reviewed a week ago! Had I known, I never would&#39;ve ordered from here, knowing it would be an absolute complete waste of money.

So let&#39;s get on with what else they did wrong... (shocker)...

I ordered a caesar salad. It came with a handful of lettuce, bare minimum of dressing (coating the bottom of the aluminum dish it came with, and little else), and a few croutons. It tasted ok. Had it been substantial, I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying for it.

I also ordered a penne ala vodka, which, although it tasted decent (3/5 stars), it had no Parmesan, and not the slightest hint of pepper - which it desperately needed. The aluminum tin was also 1/3 full. I think I could count the pieces of pasta we received. If you&#39;ve got some time on your hands, you can count them via the photo I uploaded. It was roughly 30. That&#39;s not worth what we paid for it.

I ordered zeppoli, and instead of getting zeppoli, which are balls of dough deep fried, and completely covered in powdered sugar - instead I got tire-shaped pieces of dough (half the size of regular zeppoli), which not only aren&#39;t zeppoli, but are also covered in so little powdered sugar, that I could barely tell it existed in the first place. They were chewy (to the point of actually hurting your jaw), and tasted old and stale.

I ordered beef patties, which were good, but how hard is it to re-heat Jamaican beef patties after they&#39;ve already been made for you?

I so rarely give a place 1 star - I usually reserve it for restaurants where I literally get sick off the food. But this place was so dismissive, didn&#39;t care about their customers complaints (like paying for something online that was never delivered), and going so far as to take their phone off the hook to avoid answering it when a customer complains... 
Come on, that&#39;s just nonsense. And it&#39;s nonsense that no one should have to deal with.

No thank you. I will most CERTAINLY be ordering from elsewhere, and advise that you do the same.

Their ignoring of my phone calls is frustrating, and the longer they ignore, the longer my frustration grows, because you know what - when you mess up an order - especially one that a customer has already paid for - it&#39;s your responsibility as a conscientious restaurant - to make sure that customer gets said order - even if they order an hour before your closing time, and it takes you an hour to deliver it, leaving them less than a minute to call you back to complain about the order you messed up. And if it&#39;s an inconvenience to you to remain open for a few mins. longer when you&#39;ve messed up someone else&#39;s order, then that&#39;s something you should deal with. Now I&#39;M dealing with a messed up order until they re-open tomorrow at noon, and I&#39;ll be starving all night for them having forgotten my meal, (the rest of this order was my boyfriend&#39;s - thankfully I stole a bite of everything), and being too cocky to pick up the phone to remedy it. 

[Edit] - I&#39;m increasing their rating to 2 stars because they just agreed to deliver the spinach roll I didn&#39;t get yesterday. It tastes ok (3/5) but is about 25% smaller than your average spinach roll. They make the same mistake of their Ave. U Luigi&#39;s location of not chopping the spinach up first, so you take a bite, and the entire rolls contents drag out of the dough, and are gone. Wouldn&#39;t order again. Not impressed.",0
"Disgusting rotten food! I ordered a pound of Fajitas tonight &amp; they gave me only 1/2 this amount.  Salsa is VERY watery which was bad enough, but as soon as we tasted it, we knew it was DEF ROTTEN! I called to complain about them giving us too little fajita meat &amp; they CERTAINLY knew that they did &amp; that they were busted, so they offered to give us extra meat on our next order.  I wasnt buying that nonsense, so I insisted they give us our missing portion that same night.  I then also told them about the Salsa being rotten..they are such LIARS!!!! This salsa was !00% ROTTEN, tasting RANCID &amp; ACIDIC!!!  The lady finally agreed to compensate, but when I got there, she demanded to see the salsa first, but I explained that it had been used on the fajitas.  She lied, telling me that it was lime that they put in the Salsa and that is why it tasted like this..this is TOTAL BS!!! I know what fermented tomatoes &amp; onions taste like..Sorry! The lady then VERY reluctantly gave me a small cup with about 2 ounces of meat to compensate for underdoing our 1lb of chicken order...I almost didnt even want it at this point...This place is just GROSS!!! They give people old, rotten food, and then lie to your face about it too! This Grotesque place should be SHUT DOWN by the board of health ASAP!!! STEER CLEAR...not worth getting food poisoning!!!!",0
"I got badly sick after eating a romaine salad there yesterday. I have symptoms of stomach flu, i.e. fatigue, nausea, low grade fever, vomiting, etc.",1
"I really wanted to like this place, as the outdoor garden area has a great ambience and is just steps away from my apartment. However, those were the only positive things I can say. I have been to the midtown location for a private party and I thought the food there was pretty good, unlike its sister restaurant in Soho. For starters, we ordered about 8 mezzes, none of which were good. The octopus was extremely dry and chewy, lacking flavor. For entree, I ordered the lobster risotto and after taking one bite I decided it better to let the $32 plate go uneaten than get food poisoning. The lobster had definitely turned rotten and the risotto was overcooked, mushy and oversalted (and this is coming from a salt fiend). 

With an outdoor spot like this, I think it could pass with even decent food but this was not the case here. The drinks we tried were okay and the service was pretty attentive but I will not be going back. A real disappointment.",0
"it is very sad to say but I designed and built this venue it took more than 5 years helping this man Steve Walters for free not a dollar I did it for cost and was put in serious debt from it for helping . I would say thank you to any one that thinks the place is beautiful i busted my a%s to build it you can see the intense work on monstarproductions.com from the layout lighting ac the works i even told the architects what to do I only received 1,2 million material and labor and I only charged him 1.4 mil

cost and not even a thank you just insults and lies from Steve and his father I did not want to write this but I had to let people know the truth about these frauds . I would never ask any one to not go and I do not wish them bad because I believe in Karma strongly and they will get what is coming . one of the millionare owners even said we do not have a contract with this guy so why should we pay him . reckless and terrible 
I am sick to my stomach from getting sick and wearing myself from the intense labor 
doing all the extras and getting a slap in the face . as far as chris noth wow people just look at him his energy says it all they had nothing to do with the layout but me and it is taken away

Steve and your father and MR noth I wish you all the best liars all of you

"This review isn&#39;t about the ambiance, the people, or the sports. I am giving it an extra star because the trivia night was fun.

This review is about the food and drinks which are an important component to any worthwhile after work bar visit. Come here if you have extra money to throw away on nothing. I had the worst pour with a cup full of ice on both of my $11 drinks. It felt like it was a glass o watery soda with a tiny splash of alcohol. Stingiest pours ever. I get way better at $3 happy hours at many bars in LES. I felt completely ripped off. I wish I asked how much the drink was before I ordered a second. 

Hand down the worst bar food I have ever eaten. Chicken fingers were gross, and the nachos made me sick to my stomach.

Despite it being steps away from my house...Royal I will not be back.",0
"Don&#39;t buy the party packages that this place sales. The food is horrible!!! I tried the food that they sale in the bakery and it was good, and that convince me to buy a party package for my daughter&#39;s birthday. The empanadas and the sandwiches tasted very weird, and they were poorly made. The tres leches cake was awful. I still wonder of what kind of meat they made the croquettes, they were really bad. I got sick of food poison for three days after I ate this food. It was a dramatic experience. I don&#39;t recommend to nobody to buy the party package from this place. I&#39;m very disappointed and disgusted.",1
"Got sick!!!!! Please don&#39;t eat here. First off, a friend and I came and ordered the Korean drink makkulli and a pajeon as starters and said we will order more. The waitress was nasty and gave us a dirty look. Then another one came and said because you didn&#39;t order a main dish we will only give you kimchi. So we felt pressured to order more and ordered a jeongohl. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Do not eat here my friend and I got sooooo sick afterwards and got food poisoning and threw up all night long.  Never again. For your sake DO NOT EAT HERE.",1
"Great cupcakes!  Moist, fluffy frosting and just the right size!  I don&#39;t like getting the huge cupcakes that other places have because they&#39;re just too big and I usually feel kinda sick after I eat one.  Georgetown cupcakes was a cute, very clean shop and they also give the first 100 customers of the day a free cupcake - how great is that?!",0
"I was glad to see some honest review about this place. I was also fooled by the good comment about this place. We went there few weeks ago with my family. The place was too small for family of six. Our presence overwhelmed the place and they were not capable of managing few more people.

Talking about the food, I was really upset. Their so called popular lamb chops were not ever well cooked. And the presentation really sucked! I think due to that uncooked food I got sick the next day. 

My brother tried their mango chicken which had only mango and no chicken. The food seems like it came straight out of a can.

Later, we found out that the chief was off that day and the owner-old lady was making our food. 

I strongly advice others to call them and asked them if the chief is working or not before going to that place.",1
"you&#39;d think that after studying and passing the new york bar exam i&#39;d be sick to my stomach at the idea of sitting in another coffee shop . . . ahh, but you&#39;d be wrong. turns out my comfort zone IS the coffee shop. pleasant people watching, delicious cup o&#39; brew, typically great music, and an escape into my thoughts and ideas. yes, coffee shops are places where i can zone out and read and write to my heart&#39;s content.

it was a great surprise to find birch, just one subway stop away from my apartment. i had known of the flat iron location for quite some time but just never made it there. and while i had every intention of making lenox coffee my go-to neighborhood coffee shop, i&#39;m a tiny little gal. and tiny little gals probs shouldn&#39;t go too far uptown into harlem alone at night. (yo, i&#39;m just being real . . . can never be too careful!) hence, my venture to 96th street one sunday evening.

i didn&#39;t really know what to expect from birch. but, i definitely have high standards for coffee shops (check out my list - &#34;it&#39;s espresso, not expresso&#34; for all my coffee shop adventures).

aside from the fact that i walked in and stood at the counter for a solid 2-3 minutes before i was greeted (looks like a baristo was socializing with some guests), i was pleasantly surprised.

the space is significantly large, but not dangerously cavernous (take note, bourbon coffee). the menu is extensive - i noticed a dinner menu and beer, but settled for a decaf cafe au lait. the baristo was super nice and helpful. the music selection was on point. and perhaps my favorite part . . . CANDLES! yes, there are tiny candles at each table. shut up. i dunno . . . there&#39;s just something beautiful about a cute coffee shop, candlelit at night, great music playing. ya see . . . i&#39;d rather fall in love with someone at a coffee shop (or library) than at some random bar. shrug.

i didn&#39;t use the Internet (strictly a reading and writing sort of night), so i can&#39;t attest to how good or bad it is.

regardless, i plan on being a frequent customer here. and i&#39;m hoping i get better service next time i visit. not that service was terrible - i&#39;m being picky here. but, it seems rather rude to ignore a customer for almost 3 minutes, especially when the place isn&#39;t packed. but, i&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt.",0
"I am writing this review because I feel compelled to let others know my experience to perhaps prevent it from happening again.  This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.  I needed to take a shower after eating here and felt that I might be physically sick later that night.  The food is awful, the place is dirty, the service is beyond terrible and it was so bad I can&#39;t find the words to express how positively disgusting this place is but what I do not understand is how it got an A rating?!

I had read the mixed reviews before arriving but my friend raved about it and so with trepidation, I ordered a simple Caesar Salad with grilled Chicken: how can you screw this up?  Well they managed to do so and the dressing made me sick later that same night.

There are so many other nicer restaurants along this same block: CHOOSE ANOTHER ONE &amp; STAY AWAY FROM PAESANO&#39;S OF MULBERRY STREET.",1
"food tastes great at first, but last week, my family and friends experienced food poisoning. i know this happens but not when you&#39;re paying for expensive mexican food.  i reported this to the health department because the incident can be isolated to their food. i ordered the cheese enchilada. their food tastes better than dos caminos, but then again, i never got sick from dos caminos.",1
"I don&#39;t know what the hell happened! I used to love this place, but we took some folks from out of town from dinner and it was horrible. Granted, it was a late dinner. But still! My pasta was so salty that it made me sick. Also, the braised ribs were sub-par... Sigh...",0
"I really want to love this place considering its just a few blocks from my apartment, and the outside bar is awesome, but I&#39;ve now been here twice and had terrible experiences both times sooo I&#39;m done. The food here is fine, nothing special, but the service is horrific. 

The first time I came, we did the family style dinner for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday with a big group, and the service was awful, despite the restaurant being totally empty (weirdly and awkwardly empty, actually). I have a very strong stomach, and got VIOLENTLY ill that night and was sick for 2 days after. I know this can happen anywhere, so we gave it another try last weekend and had drinks at the outside bar. What could go wrong? Our waitress completely ignored us - it took us about 20 minutes to order a drink (again, it was basically empty) and then she never came back again to ask if we wanted another one. She finally came back after another like half hour of waiting and said, oh did you want another one or did you want the check? Great sales tactic. Oh and the hummus we ordered came with literally 4 pita chips. 

We are NOT complainers (I don&#39;t remember ever complaining to a manager before) but at 15 dollars a drink, I decided to say something. The manager apologized (sort of) and proceeded to give us the check with nothing taken off. At this point we just left and didn&#39;t argue because we just wanted to leave but... never.again.",1
"Decent Indian food, average service. Fun fact, got food poisoning, and have now had it for the past 3 days. I&#39;ve literally gone to the bathroom nearly 50 times now, and used up what i would estimate to be around 5-6 rolls of tissue. I know it was here because it was the only place that both me and my brother had eaten at together, and we both have very similar symptoms. Never coming back here again.",1
"Worst Korean food and service.  Got sick from old food.  Yukgaejang was old with mushrooms and egg?!  Soondooboo was gray color and just gross.  Banchan was old and going bad.  Kimchi was sour as vinegar.  Overall, disgusting and I paid for it the next day with stomach pain.",1
"Whenever I go here, it&#39;s to bring a friend from out of town or to get matzoh ball soup when I&#39;m really, really sick. Obviously it&#39;s kitschy and iconic in a way that makes the trip worthwhile for those reasons alone, and the sandwiches are both monstrously large as well as delicious. However, the long lines and weird take-a-ticket method of ordering take something away from the experience, as do the astronomical prices and often negative attitudes of the men working the counter. Still, it&#39;s a classic for a reason. Go at least once.",0
"This place could be awesome, but the service is incredibly poor and they most certainly refill cheaper liquor into premium bottles.  Me and my friends got terribly sick from just a few cocktails.",1
"The most positive experience I had about this place was the surprise of the cute bathroom.  It wasn&#39;t clean, but cute.  The margaritas are pretty good too - IF you can get one.  I recently went there for a large birthday party and since we walked in the door at 7pm we were met with the rudest waitress on earth.  First of all, she wasn&#39;the even presentable. Second, some of our party was already there and one in particular had her son sitting in the booth very well behaved and a stroller with her baby out of the way.  We showed up with our son as well and asked for a high chair.  The waitress goes on to say, &#34;her stroller is in the way and the high chair won&#39;t fit&#34;.  what??  I looked at her and said, &#34;her stroller is not in the way, so go get the high chair&#34;.  I don&#39;t know what crawled up her butt but the tone in her voice was unnecessary and neither was the eye rolling.  Then we asked for our drinks and that went well but she wanted to take our menu&#39;s away after ordering appetizers.  I had to inform the waitress that we were ordering entrees as well so taking the menu away wasn&#39;t helping.  Later I asked for another drink and 1 hour later I never got it.  That hour later we got our appetizer.  Then we ordered our entrees and an hour later we got our food.  Oh, but ordering the entree didn&#39;t come without an issue either.  We asked for the empanadas but two with beef and one with cheese only to be told, &#34;we can&#39;t do that&#34;.  Why?  She says, &#34;because we would have to open them to find out which ones they were&#34;. What??  You mean to tell me that you haven&#39;t the slightest clue what empanada has what inside??  Okay, so then she says, &#34;i&#39;ll check and get them.&#34;  Then, we asked for the churrasco chicken and she comes back to say, &#34;those plates only come with &#39;morro&#39; and nothing more&#34;.  Uh....okay.  Oh and no salad available either at this place even though it&#39;s on the menu.  Overall, we didn&#39;t enjoy the experience. We made the best of it, but didn&#39;t enjoy the attitude, rudeness, and the amount of TIME it took to get the food and drinks.  It would be ridiculous to say that they did a great job, because they didn&#39;t.  One last thing, they are over priced and the food isn&#39;t even that good for that price. PLUS, one of us even got FOOD POISONING.",1
"I&#39;ve eaten LA Burrito over 30 times in the last 4 years. Recently the chicken burritos gave me food poisoning twice.

It used to be a perfectly good place to eat, but I suppose they have changed their ways.",1
"Seriously? I don&#39;t go yelp but I had go on in to give this review.  How does this place function?  Also, get an A from the health inspection.  Beef ribs?  I vomited after eating 2 ribs.  Southern fried chicken?  I vomited after eating 1 and I don&#39;t know how old that fryer oil was but it was ineadable.  Corn bread?  I felt like the saliva in my mouth was getting sucked out because it was so dry. Mac and cheese?  Microwaved mush.  Morel of the story? DO NOT STEP FOOT IN THIS RESTURANT!!  And one more note... I think they wipe the tables down with urine.... GROSSSS!!!",1

"Came here on a saturday night with a few gfs.  One of the primary reasons for choosing this place was b/c of the mussels featured on their menu, and a resulting search for &#34;gastropub&#34;.  
I&#39;m not sure i can really call this place a gastropub.. its just a pub.. with extremely mediocre food.  The place wasn&#39;t that crowded at 9pm, so not sure why they were out of the mussels, highly disappointed.  The waiter suggested the salmon burger, sure why not.  I&#39;ll tell you why not.. TERRIBLE.  The fishiest tasting salmon burger i have ever had in my life. Mushy would best describe it. I honestly felt sick afterwards, thank goodness i only had a few bites, ugh.  My friend got the oyster sliders...she only ate 1.5/3.
It was too dark in there to tell but.. whats up with the curry ketchup? yuck.
My friend had the pork sliders, those were much much better, and i would recommend getting if you found yourself upon this place.  
Service-a little snooty for a pub don&#39;t you think? A shame, the venue itself has a lot of potential... alas..we won&#39;t be back.",0
"The Prime Rib sandwich is great.  Just juicy meat in a roll.  Delicious.  They have some other sandwiches depending on the day.  The Friday sandwich, Braised Brisket Meatballs, had the look of texture of canned cat food.  It was gross and I&#39;ll never get it again.  

Also, I think the employees in this section of Eataly are the worst, especially the cashier.  I get a little sick of their attitudes.  Other areas of Eataly have nice and friendly employees, making the high prices a bit more palatable.",0
"My husband and brother got food poisoning from this place.  They both ate burgers.  My brother ended up in the hospital because he was seriously ill.  After realizing he was sick, we looked it up on the sanitation ratings site and saw that they are riddled with sanitation issues including live roaches and evidence of mice near the food, improper hand washing facilities, etc.  The food tasted okay but got them very sick!",1
"Three of us tried Jeepney for brunch a month ago and had a nice meal.  I will say that the restaurant itself has a lot of kinks to work out.  When we went either the A/C was on the fritz or not working at all because it was HOT in the restaurant.  We actually sat outside in the back terrace and it was cooler out there than it was in the restaurant itself.  The back terrace was hot, but at least there was a breeze.  Also, the service was not great.  No complaints about our individual waitress because you could tell she was getting killed in there, but the restaurant either needs to hire more servers or do something to work out the kinks in service because the people all around us were getting really angst-y about how long it took to order, get your check, etc.  Again, maybe someone called in sick or something else happened.  Who knows.

Now for the food, it was all good (if really heavy).  I had the bulalo (bone marrow, some sort of hash with some fried eggs on top, beef broth and rice), my husband had the longganisa sausage with fried rice (another fried egg) and a cucumber salad.  Both entrees were very tasty.  I want to try some of the other entrees on their dinner menu (including the chori burger and the pork shoulder), but I&#39;m not in a huge hurry to go back.  We also ordered the halo halo (it seemed appropriate given the heat).  It wasn&#39;t bad but I think the version at Pig and Khao is better.",0

My girlfriend and I thankfully stumbled upon this place while heading to the bank and it might just be our new favorite spot. After being disappointed so many times in our neighborhood (Blend, Skinnys Cantina, Shi, Masso, etc) we finally had a meal where everything we ordered was excellent.

We&#39;ll need to come back a few times and explore the rest of the menu, but today we had the chips and salsa (a mix of standard chips, plantains and crispy eggplant slices with a sampling of salsa and hummus), a beet/aruglua/goat cheese salad, yuca gnocchi and a curried chicken pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and much cheaper than we expected. We would have easily paid double in Manhattan without complaining a bit.

Someone complained about the small size of the plates but I think they were nitpicking a bit. The gnocchi dish (our favorite) was on the smaller side but the chips/salsa plate was huge by comparison (we were almost full after eating just that) so I recommend asking your server about the size of each dish prior to ordering.

The GM Josh was a super cool Aussie guy who makes you feel like you&#39;re the most important guests in the house. Since we visited on a Monday afternoon, I cant vouch for the service in the evening but we will definitely come back and find out for ourselves. However, we&#39;ll probably come back first for the amazing brunch specials we read about.

So if you&#39;re looking for something new in LIC and you&#39;re sick of being disappointed then check out Open Door and for the love of God, please try the yuca gnocchi.",0
"Sad how quickly this went south. Checked it out opening week and it was decent.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s turned into stroller central though that&#39;s the least of its issues.  Avoid the food at all costs. Terrible food poisoning. The bathrooms were Mars Bar bad. Never acceptable where food is being served.  The outdoor space is nice, but just not worth it given the mediocre (and not cheap) cocktails and mediocre beer selection. I full expect this place to go the way of Lorelei unless they make some major changes immediately. Can&#39;t see how they can survive the cold season without anything to speak safe for the space.

Note on other reviews, cheap does not necessarily equal good.",1
"I used to order from here but got food poisoning from their beef burrito last time. I was told the general manager would call me but after calling four times to get a hold of her, never got a call back.",1
"This is now the only fish market in FH, which is very very sad.  The prices there are anywhere from overpriced to outrageous, while some of the fish do not look really fresh at all.  Since buying fish at Keyfood or Trade Fair is probably asking for food poisoning, people will probably continue to buy from FH Fishery.  Personally, I either catch my own fish or buy from Asian markets.  The workers there, however, are always friendly.",0
"Came here on a saturday night with a few gfs.  One of the primary reasons for choosing this place was b/c of the mussels featured on their menu, and a resulting search for &#34;gastropub&#34;.  
I&#39;m not sure i can really call this place a gastropub.. its just a pub.. with extremely mediocre food.  The place wasn&#39;t that crowded at 9pm, so not sure why they were out of the mussels, highly disappointed.  The waiter suggested the salmon burger, sure why not.  I&#39;ll tell you why not.. TERRIBLE.  The fishiest tasting salmon burger i have ever had in my life. Mushy would best describe it. I honestly felt sick afterwards, thank goodness i only had a few bites, ugh.  My friend got the oyster sliders...she only ate 1.5/3.
It was too dark in there to tell but.. whats up with the curry ketchup? yuck.
My friend had the pork sliders, those were much much better, and i would recommend getting if you found yourself upon this place.  
Service-a little snooty for a pub don&#39;t you think? A shame, the venue itself has a lot of potential... alas..we won&#39;t be back.",0
"I loved the place about 10 years ago, Great dogs , very reasonable price but you had to wait in line for a while but is was worth it !  I just recentley brought my chidren and there friends there to experience it , WHAT A MISTAKE !!!!  The dogs taste like crap mushy and tasteless buns were stale and topping rite out of the can , The juices are horrible made from concentrate not fresh and top off the $ 65 dollars for this garbage we all got sick on the way home. My Advise STAY AWAY go to the guy on any corner, much better and much cheaper. This tourist trap from the 1980&#39;s should close there doors and never reopen !",1
"Having discovered Ethiopian food about a year ago was such a doubled-edged sword: my boyfriend is so sick of hearing me talk about it, want it, beg for it, eating it, etc. and this food is like crack, I literally want it every day, even for dessert after eating it for dinner. Nonethless, I got him to go last weekend :)..

Came here via their Groupon on Saturday night. 2 apps, 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine for $35. The restaurant was empty which made us nervous, but I&#39;m never in a bad mood when I am getting my Ethiopian food fix in. 

TIPS:
-The honey wine was just okay-- Awash&#39;s is much better. The waitress did offer to let us choose any wine on the menu (before we ordered), so you may wish to opt for that. 
-We both got the avocado salad as our appetizer (pictured). This salad was DELICIOUS. Fresh avocado, tomato and onion in a lemony dressing served on injera. Really excellent. 
-We both ordered the Meskel combo (pictured). I don&#39;t like lamb, so she was nice enough to substitute that out for me. The serving appears much smaller than Awash&#39;s, but it is so filling, don&#39;t let it fool you. Everything was tasty-- I&#39;m not a huge fan of the collared greens, but that&#39;s person. The tibs wat is also better at Awash, but still good here. 

I thought the Groupon deal was excellent, particularly if you get the weeknight one for $29. 

FYI- The UCB (Upright Citizen&#39;s Brigade) is around the corner, so we caught a 10pm comedy show (pre-planned). It made for a wonderful date. We will come back to this restaurant, particularly with our second Groupon.  
My bf and I both",0
"Two friends and I stopped in for a celebratory lunch recently. The staff overheard us discussing said event and were congratulatory, which was a plus. 

I had the Mac &amp; cheese which was to die for. Friends had the beet salad and burger, plus extra plate of fries. Everything was good but one friend got sick later, leading us to believe there was gluten in the fries (she explained she was gluten free when requesting her burger minus the bun, but didn&#39;t make a big deal about it -- perhaps she should have been more clear so they knew it was a real gluten allergy and not just the latest trendy diet). 

Still a great place, especially for the neighborhood.",0
"Service? Atrocious! Food? If I ever need a day off from work because of food poisoning, I&#39;d make sure I come back here.",1
"After reading all the rave reviews about Schnitzi, I finally decided to try it out. What a mistake!!!
The place is filthy, the menu prices are too high and the food sucks. I tried their double burger. They barely put tomatoes or pickles in my sandwich. The sauce wasn&#39;t that great, but the worst part was the meat. The burgers were two pieces of rubber that tasted horrible.
All night I was burping nasty burps that felt like I ate a whole rotten cow. The next day I was still sick from this crappy burger and all my clothes smelled of filthy food.
I don&#39;t recommend this place to anyone.",0
"I was skeptical ordering from here since I&#39;ve never had sushi that was Kosher but I must say that i was pleasantly surprised.  The food is great.  The prices are decent.  

I have two gripes with the place:
1. They observe the Jewish Sabbath so their hours of business are not those of the typical restaurant.  We have learned this a couple of times when we wanted some sushi after work on a Friday and they were already closed.

2. When they are open, they do not always deliver.Twice in the last 2 months I have called for delivery and was told that they could not deliver that night (I live 3 blocks away.).  Only once was I told a reason: the delivery guy was out sick.  I don&#39;t know if the missing delivery guy was the reason for the first delivery refusal but both times this place lost $40+ of business that night.

I would suggest to Yama that they work out their delivery issues and perhaps work on hiring someone who can operate the business during the Sabbath.  I&#39;ve seen the owner and he is ALWAYS there.  Other than the sushi chef I never see any other employees so I&#39;m guessing he must close the business for religious observance.  

Of course this is his business to operate as he sees fit but I suspect that not keeping standard hours is literally leaving money on the dinner table to other sushi places in the area which do not seem to be as good as Yama.",0
"We managed to catch Fatta Cuckoo on a bad day. Their chef had called in sick and the sous chef was left by himself in the kitchen to handle all the food orders. The writing was on the wall when we walked in. They messed up our reservation of 2, and had us sit at the bar but we got a free round of drinks so no hard feelings.

We started off with the fried clam special. A bit bready but tasted fine.  We had ordered the burger and the fried chicken, but after waiting for over an hour since the arrival of our app, we still hadn&#39;t gotten them. They recognized this and gave us more free drinks. To give you an idea how backed up they were - our reso was at 730 but we didn&#39;t get our entrees until 915. Finally when my burger came, it was cooked medium well (I had ordered medium rare) and I had no choice but to send it back. To their credit, they gave me another burger within 10 minutes that was cooked much better.

The short rib burger, at the correct temperature, was pretty good but not sure if it&#39;s worth the $22 price tag even though it does come with a beer. It could be due to the unfortunate case of not having the regular chef that night but while the meat was juicy, it lacked seasoning. The fried chicken wasn&#39;t too different. It was moist under the dark, crispy skin but the flavor didn&#39;t pop as much. Overall I&#39;d give the app and entrees 3.5/5

We also got a free dessert on top all the drinks and apologies we got from the frustrated staff. I tried the chocolate cream pie which I thought was delicious and devoured in two minutes. 

One good thing that came out of going there on a off night was that because of the free drinks they gave us, we got to try a lot of the cocktails. Not The Girl Next Door was an excellent chili infused mescal cocktail that I&#39;d order over and over again. For something summery and light I would suggest Don&#39;t Tell Carly.

Restaurants can have off nights due to unforeseen circumstances and I felt Fatta Cuckoo came through for us that night despite being in a very tough situation with the absence of the regular chef. We were also helped by a Travelzoo deal we had but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to pay their regular prices for the quality of food we received. However I&#39;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and come back here another time.

FOOD: 3.5/5
SERVICE: 5/5
D?COR &amp; AMBIANCE: 3/5
VALUE: 3.5/5 (4/5 with the Travelzoo deal)",0
"Weird place, but I kinda dig it.  It&#39;s BYO, a rarity in New Yawk, and definitely is a total crap hole in the wall, but it gets rowdy and it&#39;s en route to my boo&#39;s casa. Plus, having food poisoning every now and again is cheaper than getting a colonic.",1
"Its a great place to eat.. if you like &#34;real&#34; meatballs.  I put it in quotes because i&#39;m vegetarian, and I&#39;m NOT a fan of the veggie meatball.  I was pretty sick that night and the next day from eating it.  So vegetarians beware, hopefully you have stronger stomaches than me.  But they have some great staff and they&#39;re very friendly.  My boyfriend loved the food.",1
Worst whole foods in manhattan. This evening I witnessed this young woman and her BABY be antagonized by this other woman at the hot food bar. This woman took a serving spoon that was literally in his woman&#39;s hand. They exchanged conversation and the spoon was returned to the woman with the baby. This other woman proceeded to tower over her and continued to look down on top of her while her baby was sitting there obviously waiting to be fed. More words were exchanged and the woman with the baby called an employee over to handle the situation. I heard a part where this woman with the child exclaimed something about kicking both of them out.  and this other girl left to the other side of the counter with the fellow who worked there and they began to gab and laugh.  Then he came back to the woman with the child a and told her to leave. My jaw DROPPED. I am in dismay for this poor woman and her BABY. What a way to treat a customer. No way am I ever coming back to this whole foods. I am disgraced that I&#39;ve spent so much time and money here since they have opened. My heart really goes out to that woman. I am so disgusted by this matter. I wanted to say something and I now regret not although I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t have mattered. To the woman who took the spoon out of the mothers hand---you should be ashamed of yourself.  What is wrong with you!!!!  What a sick thing to do! I feel nauseous thinking about it. He whole scene makes me sick to my stomach. To the whole foods employee. YOU should be ashamed of yourself. To the young mother. I hope I see you again in the neighborhood. I personally will never shop here anymore. I am quite sickened by this. I will personally pay to have your groceries delivered from another whole foods for you. Being asked to leave was a favor. They really did you a favor and I will not set foot back in and I hope I never see you set foot. I can tell you and your child are both a blessing and this other woman clearly was a hater towards your beauty. I really hope I see you again. Please don&#39;t go back there. It really was a favor having you leave. Everything is a blessing in disguise. I wish you and your family the best blessings and I do hope to see you again.  This whole foods is bad business. I will no longer be a patron.,0
"I was much disappointed by the experience dining here on a Monday evening during restaurant week. The service was stellar, however, the Atlantic salmon entree was bland and the rest of the courses were unexceptional. To make matters worse, a few hours after leaving, I realized I had a case of food poisoning! This is really unforgivable from what should be a true NY establishment dedicated to excellence.

I am scheduled to be celebrating a birthday there next week and debating whether I should warn my party to consider revising the location. Lack of flavor is forgivable, but 
food-poisoning is a sanitary issue!",1
"I&#39;ve been dying to try this place since it first opened when I was a penny pinching Architorture student. Now that I&#39;m a struggling designer I thought lets give it a go nearly a decade later during Restaurant Week. Unfortunately when we turned up for dinner our waiter informed us that they only do a special at lunch and they offer the lunch Bento box all year around so it&#39;s bullshit anyway. Okay so we hunkered down for dinner next to a lovely couple visiting NYC for 24hours. We got to know them quite intimately since our tables were practically on top of each other the spacing was so cramped. The Tadao Ando designed space holds up pretty well, at least the concrete columns do. The undulating ribbon ceiling is starting to fray around the edges. The walls are pretty, pretty filthy and dusty that is and there is a wall made of plastic bottles. I&#39;ve heard a lot about the bathroom, it is extravagant and so over spec&#39;d it only seems useful if your going taking a shit. I imagine they hope their food is of a quality high enough that their patrons aren&#39;t running to take a dump during their meals. Who goes to Morimoto to take a shit?  The toilet is more imaginative than the menu which is tired and boring. When you come with an Australian and they see an Aussie Wagyu Steak for nearly $100 and piss themselves laughing you realise why they have such a fancy bidet. We ordered the Surf &amp; Turf and the recommended Braised Cod. The food was cooked well but the dishes are disappointing especially below quality, presence and imagination for the price. The minuscule bite size amount of steak was typical, mushy mix of avocado and sashimi and lilliputian potatoes. The sauce for the braised cod was too sickly sweet as was the super sweet cocktail which tasted like what we call &#34;lolly&#34; (candy) water. Our waiter was above average but you would have to be given how much they have to overcompensate for. Maybe its just one of those places where you have to walk in without any expectations because you should expect nothing of this menu.",0
"Was super excited to try this place for Restaurant Week. We had 7pm reservations for a Friday night, which were shockingly easy to get for 2. It&#39;s very a large space so it doesn&#39;t have much atmosphere in the way you would expect from a NY restaurant, but it was never overly loud where we were seated. It&#39;s definitely very pricey, but if you can afford it, I think it&#39;s worth it. We tried almost everything on the menu. The uovo raviolo was absolutely sublime. It has a nice heady truffle flavor and the yolk just melted out. My boyfriend said his lobster wasn&#39;t terribly impressive, but he&#39;s from a coastal town. The beef cheeks entree and the veal were delicious though. The beef cheeks were perfectly tender and would make a great winter dish - they may have been a bit heavy for summer but I still loved it. The char on the veal was perfect. It tasted like summer should be. Beautifully charred and tender. They accidentally screwed up our dessert order but it worked out in our favor since we got to try all the desserts on offer. Their gelatos are actually more like ice cream (not as creamy as gelato usually is) and chocolate was pretty bland, but the vanilla had this great almost herbal/floral flavor to it that I found really unique. The Bhaba al rhum was sticky on the outside and sickly sweet and yet somehow dry on the interior. The whipped cream looked like it came from a can. Would totally pass on that one. But the panacotta was a dream. It had just enough structure to give it some tooth but was still delightfully creamy and over the top. It has definitely inspired me to make my own at home. Our server was great and attentive, he remembered your drink order without being prompted. It was a nice experience.",0
"Completely terrible restaurant and experience! I have been here numerous times and although not always amazing, the food and service was never so bad that I couldn&#39;t eat there, until now! I went there twice over the last month and I will never step foot into that restaurant again.  My hamburger was so bad that I actually had to spit it out and ask the waiter if the meat had gone bad.  He did not seem the least bit surprised and brought me out a turkey sandwich about 30 minutes later.  I left the restaurant completely disappointed and disgusted at that.  My husband and I both got sick from their food that night.  Do not go here!!",1
"Excellent food, decent price, all made fresh and in front of you.  Decor feels a bit sterile but, overall, this place is banging.  Most of the neg reviews on this site reference Darling&#39;s policy limiting laptops to certain sections of the restaurant.  I say GOOD, get those freakin nerds out of here! I&#39;m sick of going to coffee shops and having someone on a laptop hogging all the seating, all day long.  If you want an office - get one...or use the library!  Stop hating on Darling for limiting your land grabbing ass.   Thanks to Darling&#39;s smart policy now the rest of us can actually sit down in a coffee shop",0
"TACO NO WAY. Horrible, disgusting, I hope I don&#39;t wake up with food poisoning. I was lazy but should have walked to Chipotle&#39;s on 3rd. Nasty place, nastier food.",0
"NEVER GO THIS PLACE FOR FOOD.
I once had gotten food poisoning after eating food here when I first moved here in UES. Gross food and disgusting smell. I do not think they check the quality of the food in the buffet side.
Generally all the products are overpriced as well.",1
"I thought I already reviewed this place many times over. Go figure.

FIVE STARS FOR FOOD. Well, maybe 4.5, but the most of the food is good, nicely cooked, and nicely presented. I didn&#39;t happen to like the stuffed squid that a lot of people rave about, but for me, bbq squid taste is not the best paired with kind of kani salad stuffing. Sushi are surprisingly good, special kinds more so - and not at all expensive. Awesome beef negimaki. Best satay chicken ramen. Some good desserts.
FOUR STARS FOR SETTING. Small place literally stuffed with tables, there is even a littlest table imaginable in the corner by the door where the umbrella  stand used to be. Not awful, but when it&#39;s crowded.. it&#39;s c r o w d e d!
THREE STARS FOR PATCHY SERVICE. If you are lucky to get a good server (in person or on the phone), you&#39;re in for a great experience. If today is not your day, well, your food may come out late, or not done as you wanted, - or not at all.
ZERO STARS FOR CHIPMUNK FRONT DESK GIRL! She is always curt, never a smile or a howareyou / haveaniceday,  always giving attitude... She starts inventing rules on the spot, like that you can only get a 3 roll special when dining in - when it&#39;s not said anywhere in the menu or in restaurant, and we ordered it to go or to be delivered several times and never had an issue. I asked to have fried banana dessert to go (comes with a bit of green tea ice cream), she refused - because ice cream may melt! I asked why is it any business of hers if I want to eat my dessert outside, she said what if I go home, put melted dessert in the freezer, eat it then, and get food poisoning and return to complain? OK, so I am complaining here about her lack of service or basic customer service skills; don&#39;t see how it is better. If they have such a strict policy (which I doubt) of no ice cream to go, why not offer to make just the fried bananas to go? I would&#39;ve agreed, since you can get green tea ice cream in a store next door, and they don&#39;t care what happens to your food after it&#39;s paid for. LONGEVOUSJOY MANAGEMENT, if you read this, please do yourselves a favor and put someone else, more customer-friendly, in charge of client greeting and takeout / delivery orders?! Pretty please, with some unmelted green tea ice cream on top!

Bottom line, if you are here, have some spare time, and want to eat at a good spot - come in! If you want a to-go order or delivery... think twice, and try calling back if you hear a female voice.",0
"What a refreshing surprise!
Just when I started to come to term with paying for overprice mediocre tacos in New York, this place gave me a reality check.

Now this place is no traditional taqueria, don&#39;t come here expecting a mom &amp; pop joint with home-style flavor.  But what you CAN expect from here is clean, great flavor, and high quality product.  (for ~$3, yes...there is a small price to pay)   The topping on the tacos are not particularly &#34;generous&#34;.  But hey, Quality over Quantity.  So *ahem* if you&#39;re looking for &#34;portion&#34; - go to your local Chipolet.

At Dorado, they mostly serves Baja style taco, which consist of seafood (fish, shrimp tacos)  But they also offer burrito and quesadilla with meat such as Pollo, Carne, Carnitas and etc... 

Tacos- I got the chicken taco and the ahi tuna taco (special) and they both had great powerful taste.  They were spicy and tangy, and most important the ingredients were fresh and meat cooked very well.  Its not a traditional Baja style taco, it is creative with drizzle of house special sauces.  Creative done correctly.

Elote (Mexican grilled corn on the cob) - great value for $3.25 and very tasty. The corn are directly purchased from the Union Square Farmers Market. Now that&#39;s good stuff!

Quesadilla- Sorry for being &#34;so L.A&#34; but I don&#39;t usually order this. It just screams Americanized Mexican food to me and it&#39;s usually so greasy and heavy.  But I took a bite of one of my friends Carne Asada quesadilla and it was quiet nice.  The tortilla was grilled and toasty (non oily) and the Carne was seasoned and marinated very well.

I have to admit I have a constant fear of food poisoning whenever I decide to eat Mexican food in the city due to its lack of popularity.  However at this joint, you definitely feel safe.  Dorado drives a good amount of traffic daily, especially during lunch; hence food are constantly turning over for all day freshness.

P.S - This is also Aziz Ansari favorite taco place in NYC! Coolness +1.",0
"One of Manhattan&#39;s Treasures, The Madhatter Pub is a fantastic place to be. Alone or with friends, the garden is amazing.  I really enjoy the place.  The  baked scotcht egg and the baby crab cakes are great appetizers or just to have a nosh. This true gastro pub offers great British fare, I particularly love the salads --the King George being my favorite-- and the &#34;Guvnor&#34; sandwich. The Yorkshire Pudding is to die for. If you love desert, you cannot miss the Pears on Port wine. This jewel is more than a bar and is very reasonable. I suggest you make it your hang our even if you do not live in the hood. They also have tv&#39;s and one can enjoy a good game or a good race --ask about Formula 1 Grand Prix schedule or reruns if you are a motor head and soccer and cricket or rugby if you are home sick.",0
"NOTICE:

Do not patronize Spice Restaurant at 1479 First Avenue (77th Street) in Manhattan, New York City.

First, the food is below mediocre.  Some of us got sick and had diarrhea when we got home several hours later.  When were eating, some of the dishes didn&#39;t taste right, so we informed them about the food&#39;s taste and they would say it is the sauce... Many of us never finished the dishes we ordered...  It was that bad!!!

Second, they stuck us in an area where we were all barely able to sit.  It was not comfortable and they knew ahead of time of our party.  The staff can&#39;t handle a large party, but they are willing help themselves to bill you for good tip!!!  

Third, our table had an incomplete setting of forks and napkins for everyone.  We had to ask for the utensils when the food came out.

Fourth, we were also constantly asking for water, to which a first week working bus boy would know to keep the water class filled as a dinning room procedure.

Fifth, the management does not know how to cater or to interact with customers with their mindless policies.  At the end of the dinner they  decided to enforced it a &#34;no bring in desert policy.&#34; All that was distributed by the wife for the husband&#39;s birthday party were 12 cup cakes amongst 18 people to be eaten hand held and they charged $40 for &#34;bringing in desert.&#34;  I did not pay for this  additional charge, but the birthday husband&#39;s wife did pay as not to create a scene.  

When leaving, I confronted management and told them that it was a poor judgement call in charging us due to the circumstances that not everyone ate or used their &#34;bring in dessert services!&#34;   They responded that &#34;they don&#39;t care about losing our business&#34;...  

They think that dropping $435.00 for a party of 18 people for their mediocre food is okay?   They are out of their useless minds and you would be too, if you go and support this lousy joint!!!",1
"Worst place you could go to. Had to replace the eating utensils 3xs because they were dirty, table had to be cleaned again because they used a dirty rag. The food tasted disgusting and not to mention it had the cooks hair all over the food!!! 
To top it all off I got food poisoning and I only tried a little bit of the food until I saw all that hair on my plate :-(. They only took $5 off the bill! 
We weren&#39;t going to pay but figured I&#39;d make this review instead and warn people, especially after getting food poisoning.",1
"On our way to Jackson Hole, my buddies and I decided to try out this place. At first glance the place seems nice. The waiter greeted us and was friendly. After being seated we quickly asked us if we would like to order drinks. He then recommended some apps to us. We decided to order the Fried Calamari (big mistake!) and rack of ribs. My friends ordered a filet sandwich, hot pinwheel sausage and a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. I decided to order a chili dog without cheese and a Philly cheese steak. 

When our order finally arrive, which did take that long. Honestly, if and I mean &#34;IF&#34; the food was great, the wait would be worth it. This was not one of those situations. So our calamari arrives and I can see the disappointment in my friends eye as well as mine. It looks like something you can easily buy from the freezer of a market. It tasted rough and spoiled. Definitely not fresh. One word to describe it was disgusting! 

We finally got our entries and they were not presented well. It looks like someone took a jump-shot from the free-throw line and shot an air ball onto the plate. SPLAT!!! It was just messy, over drenched in oil, and most of all, tasted nasty. My chili dog with out cheese had an abundance of cheese and the actual hot dog was no where to be found. Basically, a sloppy joe on a hoagie. My chees steak looked okay as best, compared to the rest of the dishes. But was had absolutely no flavor, overcooked and extremely dry. I asked for hot sauce in my attempt to bring some flavor to my horrible choices in picking his place. But my hotsauce and refill was no where to be found until I asked for it a third time. 

My friends order of ribs was also okay at best. No flavor, just burnt. If you want good ribs, go to BLUE SMOKE. The filet sandwich is pretty much a glorified roast beef sandwich with brunt onions smothered on top. The cheeseburger had a weird looking mushroom which was most definitely not fresh. Not even out the can. It seems like it had been sitting out for a long time. It completely oxidized and turned black (wasn&#39;t cooked). The burger was also the size of a McDonald&#39;s hamburger. And I don&#39;t mean a big mac. I mean a happy meal size burger.

Right after taking some bites out of our dishes, one of my friends and I felt nausea. Both of us are athletes and take care of our bodies quite well and are also foodies and can usually handle all types of food. Yet this horrendous meal made both of us sick. I had massive diarrhea from their chilidog and calamari. My other friend only took a few bites out of his burger and could not force himself to eat such trash, and this guy usually eats fast food.   

So I went to the counter to ask for change for the waiters tip. The manager in his fake Gucci cap was just leaning on a counter on his phone. Once i got his attention he asked how was our meal. I politely asked, &#34;Would you like the honestly truth?&#34; He said yes, so i told him. This was not good. I had higher expectations for this place and I was disappointed at almost everything. He gave me a stare down like, WHO THE YOU THINK YOU ARE? lol and said, &#34;that&#39;s the first time anyone has said that.&#34; He said all his customers love their Philly cheesesteak. So I asked, have you been to Philly? Obviously, these establishments knows nothing about food and health.

DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, DO NOT EAT HERE. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT!!!!

My Ratings...

SERVICE: 5 OUT OF 10, why? Only one server for the entire floor. Forgot out order of pinwheel which he recommended.

DRINKS: 10 OUT OF 10, why? Its fucking soda if you get that wrong, go fucking shoot yourself.

APPETIZERS: 2 OUT OF 10, why? Not fresh, appealing nor tasty. 

ENTRIES: 1 OUT OF 10, why? Not edible. Made us sick.

DESSERT: ??? Didn&#39;t want to die. Even the waiter said, &#34;I&#39;m guessing you guys don&#39;t wanna order any dessert, huh? 

LOCATION, 8 OUT OF 10, why? It&#39; located in a nice area with plenty of people who have money and are welling to pay for this over price shit hole of a restaurant/grill. Easy to find roadside parking.",1
"Definitely what this neighborhood needed! Sick decor and great atmosphere! The staff is super friendly as well. Follow Harlem public on instagram often post pictures of new food items and they all look amazing. 

Great beer choices and the combinations of food is great! Creative drink menu too!

If you have not tried put this spot i suggest you do so soon!",0
"I experienced agonizing food poisoning the day after dining here, despite having enjoyed eating here in the past.  While one never knows the cause of such things, my dinner (chicken).....really tasted weird.  In retrospect I should have sent it back - one needs to take responsibility for what one ingests.  I hope this was a fluke; however I can&#39;t imagine that I would ever return.",1
"I got sick after my first review of the place. My fiance looked up the health grades on the restaurants int he area a few days later and cumin was supposed to be closed by the health department. Look it up for yourself on the NYC health and mental hygiene website for the city. I don&#39;t understand how they are still open.

"I went to Koi bar last Saturday, we met some friends there.  We had a party of four, I had the baked crab sushi roll, the miso cod and a double tuna roll.  My girlfriend also had the baked crab and the lobster roll.  Out of the four of us, three people got sick from food poisoning.  I personally think it was the crab roll, but all of us also had an assortment of the sashimi.  My girlfriend is still sick in bed and I had to mis work recovering.  

There are far better options when it comes to sushi in Midtown- hutsuhana, gari- I&#39;d seriously suggest anything else.",1
"I came to Cocoron with my friends after hearing their great reviews of this place. I liked the atmosphere of the place, and the service is quite good. Unfortunately the cold soba I ordered was the wrong idea. I ordered the Cold Oroshi Soba after seeing the great nutritional benefits it has. It contained a lot of raw watercress, and normally I wouldn&#39;t eat uncooked vegetables. 
The problem came right after eating their raw watercress. Couple days later I started having abdominal pain and other good stuff when you get food poisoned. I went to the doctor and had my stool examined and I was infected with parasites called Liver Flukes, which is found in contaminated watercress. 
After this whole ordeal that I&#39;ve gone through, I won&#39; t be coming back ever again. It&#39;s a nice place and all, the soba I ordered wasn&#39;t that great. They should have more precaution of handling food.",1
"I ate here and 30 minutes later experienced symptoms of food poisoning. I&#39;ve reported this restaurant to 311.  After reading their health inspection reports, I&#39;m not surprised I got sick.",1
"I ordered 2 &#34;Greek pocket&#39;s&#34;, one for myself and one for my husband. We both got extremely sick and ended up with salmonella poisoning!  are u kidding me? to even imagine how long the chicken was sitting there for it to grow so much bacteria that it is contaminated is stomach turning. Seriously don&#39;t recommend this place to anyone. Not only that, I went on the nyc department of health website and they even have a violation for it, disgusting.",1
"i love almost everything about this place, from the pacman/galaga cocktail tables to the cute counter girls. the place is quite small and narrow, it was packed when i went with a couple of friends. i got the chili dog and a philly tubesteak and...MAMMA MIA! so yummy! i scarfed it down with the Pabst Blue Ribbon, an american classic beer. 

as i was munching on these dogs while watching my friends play pacman, i noticed there were people disappearing in and out of the phone booth in the corner... turns out it leads to a lounge called &#39;Please Don&#39;t Tell&#39;. thats so sick. i love NYC.",0
"Food poisoning alert

Finished eating around 2:30, sharp stomach pains by 5 pm followed by [bleep]. I&#39;m so unhappy with this place right now.

Ordered from the restaurant week lunch menu:
Mushroom stuffed with crab meat (ok, but there were pieces of shell in the crab meat)
Lobster bisque - watery and bland (not very good)
Petit filet mignon - the temp was cooked perfectly and the meat was tender, but lacking in flavor. 
Creamed spinach was ok, but very one dimensional
Crab cake w/ asparagus was ok but there were pieces of shell in the crab meat 
Shrimp add-on was good

The food would have been an &#34;a-ok&#34; 3 stars but for the good poisoning. 

The service was nice, although the hostess is a bit stuffy. The restaurant was empty, for good reason, it seems",1
"Not had any problems with their other location further uptown which is now closed. I order the half and half rib combo, as usual couldn&#39;t finish. This location is kinda like Hooters that serves BBQ. Food is comparable to Dino BBQ but i&#39;ve noticed one thing is that all BBQ places serves their food at room temperature. Remember couple of years ago they made a big fuss about Chinese restaurants serving BBQ. Thing is i never got sick from Chinese BBQ, but after Brother Jimmys i was in bed for two days.
Stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, cold sweat . Never ever again.",1
"The food was terrible. First time and last time I go to this place.  My daughter got a stomach ache from the food and my son threw up from the food. If it was myself I wouldnt be so upset but these are my kids we are talking about. In my opinion I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone unless you enjoy food poisoning.

P.S. the waitress tried to overcharge me for our meals and when I confronted the owner about it he basically laughed in my face. Very rude.",1
"Most horrid and disgusting bathroom in NYC.  I&#39;ve come to this restaurant three times.  Unfortunately, I had to use the facilities each time, and it almost made me sick at the filth.  I&#39;ll never go back.",0
"I usually love this restaurant, especially the guacamole and frozen margaritas, but after eating there last nite, I woke up with montezuma&#39;s revenge.  I had two margaritas, a guac, and chicken enchiladas, but woke up sick to my stomach the next day.  Such a disappointment.  Next time, I will just stick to the drinks or go to Rosa Mexicano.",1
Not what it used to be... Got food poisoning. Ingredients don&#39;t seem fresh. Wait staff is rude. Better places around. Avoid.,1
"I have gotten food poisoning twice from this place. Never going back, I learned my lesson finally. The food did not even taste good. The only positive from this place is no credit card minimum.",1
"my friends threw a surprise birthday party for me here and i gotta say this is one of the nicest looking restaurants ive seen in a while. the place is dimly lit and the bathroom sink is real cool ahahah. the decor is sick. we ordered sangria and the matador combo. the sangria was super yummy and as for the matador combo, i didnt speak once during the meal. devoured it. absolutely loved the avocado salad. i love peruvian food",0
"Absolutely terrible. The place is under a new name as of 8/13/13 and seems to be under new ownership. I just got back having ordered two regular slices and a buffalo slice. The chicken on the buffalo slice was dry like it&#39;s been out for three days at least, and barely any cheese. I was warned that it&#39;s spicy - it is not. As for the two regular slices, I ate one and left the second because I couldn&#39;t stomach it. The dough tastes bland, they clearly used little to no yeast in preparation, the sauce is clearly out of a can of Prego and the cheese looks melted yet is stale and not at all melty - again, like it&#39;s been out for 3 days. I will be surprised if I don&#39;t get food poisoning by the morning. On the bright side, it&#39;s cheap - then again you get what you pay for. Stale, tasteless cardboard pizza that leaves you thinking about a stomach pump like one would of a dear loved one. Off to brush my teeth. Eugh...",0
"Fast forward a day: likely food poisoning.

Should be called Pork Slop",1
"I would like to confirm that I have food poisoning from this place. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",1
gave me food poisoning,1
"I really wanted to give this place 3 stars since it was pretty tasty but I just couldn&#39;t since my friend and I both got sick shortly after eating here.  I&#39;m not saying this place was dirty because it actually looked very clean, but something definitely angered my stomach.

We got the basic vegetable broth with the fish &amp; meat ball combo, and egg noodles.  Everything was really good-- even the sauces.  After eating, we decided to walk down Roosevelt Ave. and after 10-15 minutes, my stomach started churning and I had to rush home.  I thought it was just me until I found out from my friend that she also felt very uncomfortable that evening and next morning. 

... until now, 6 days later, my stomach is still cahoots",1
"There food is just passing edible. I tried two different soups, chicken noodle and lentil. The soups were very salty and tasted basically like shit. They were probably sitting in those hot-bowls for the last 10 days or so because people don&#39;t eat them after they have an experience like I did. I thought I would be nice and give there deli a try a day later &#34;very stupid of me&#34; and I ended up getting food poisoning from it. A simple turkey club left me on the toilet and in front of a garbage can for the next two days. It tasted funny while I was eating it so I should&#39;ve realized but this place will never get my business again. Just utterly pathetic.",1

"Ordered delivery for the first and last time tonight. The estimate delivery time they gave me was 37 minutes, after one hour of waiting I called and the man on the phone told me it had just left... No apologizes for the delay or anything. 30 minutes later I finally got the food, that took a total of an hour and a half to get here. 

The falafel and dynamite sandwich we ordered tasted like they had been sitting in the delivery bike for way too long. Falafel was cold and dry, the pita wrap was soggy...

We also ordered hummus and baba ganoush which are hard to mess up. They both felt like they had just been taken out of a freezer, they were chunky and very cold. The baba ganoush had a weird tone and smell to it so we didn&#39;t eat it, and the hummus had a weird chunky consistency and was half frozen as well. The pita bread that we ordered to go with it was equally bad. Dry, tasted like cardboard, I could have bought a better pita bread at the corner store. It&#39;s hard to mess up mediterranean food as long as you use fresh ingredients, but this place didn&#39;t do a single thing right. They also forgot our salad, but I didn&#39;t bother to call about it seeing the quality of their other food. 

Only pro is that I didn&#39;t get food poisoning.",0
"This place is so disgusting it makes me sick to my stomach to even stand in here for more than a couple of minutes. When I am working out in this neighborhood and need drink I have been more and more disgusted each and every time I come in here. Once you enter this establishment you will be completely overwhelmed with the strong and pungent horrible odor of a smelly dog and urine. It is almost unbearable to a customer who is not used to regularly coming here. I bet the owners don&#39;t even smell a thing, or they don&#39;t care. Either way its gross and I will only come here again if I am completely desperate for something to drink while holding my breath the entire time.

Gross.",0
"I walked in yestrday8/14/13, got a pre-made Cobb Salad.  Immediately felt sick and had food poisoning.  I will never go back.  Home sick today feeling like garbage.  People in my office call the place dirty and now I have learned my lesson.",1
"I go there almost every week for work lunch. Their lunch menu is very good for the price. I tried almost everything on that menu, and enjoyed every single one. However, one of my coworkers got food poison from their rawfish over price so I have to bring a star down on them.",1
"This review is for delivery, not eating in the restaurant. I just ordered two Montanara pizzas, and when they arrived, they were cold and soggy, and the crusts were completely disintegrated. We couldn&#39;t even pick up the slices - it was just total mush.

I called Forcella to see if they could send new pizzas or at least give me a partial refund since the food was inedible, but they refused and said that because the guy who made the pizza said it was good, it must be fine. I told them that I&#39;ve had fried pizza before and this isn&#39;t how it&#39;s supposed to be, and they told me that I could come to the restaurant and get a new one, but they wouldn&#39;t send a new one out or do anything else to make it right. They refused to acknowledge that since I&#39;m the one holding the pizza, maybe I&#39;d know more about the quality than the guy who made it forty minutes ago? I&#39;d bet it was fine when it came out of the oven but then sat somewhere for 20 or 30 minutes, and that&#39;s why it got so soggy and gross.

I&#39;m home sick and unable to get out to the restaurant, which is also a train stop away, so I&#39;m just out thirty bucks for the pizzas. I had ordered through Seamless, and I left a review on there to warn other people about delivery, and then I noticed that a bunch of people had left very similar reviews, about how soggy and gross their pizza is when delivered.

I&#39;m not even as bummed about the inedible dinner as I am about how rude they were. Major disappointment.",0
"I have passed by this place at least 100 times and not once did I ever even consider getting something because I was afraid I would get food poisoning. But one day, my brother told me it was good and bought me a skewer - spicy chicken. 
I remember crying after eating it because it was so spicy but I ended up eating the whole thing because it was so good. 

Ever since then, whenever I go to Flushing, I always get the spicy chicken skewer. You kinda get used to the spiciness.

Anyways, I love this place. A lot. I could probably eat a skewer or two every single day.",0
"Absolutely the worst  culinary experience I had while visiting NYC.  My son and I both ordered pasta dishes and both arrived within minutes of our ordering.  Apparently, the pasta was just reheated. It was barely edible and we both got sick afterwards.",1
"I came for restaurant week (got a last minute reservation on a friday!). First, and this is why i am giving it 3 stars, they allow you to choose from the normal menu which is excellent. Another reason i am giving it 3 stars, is the wine. So good! I had the temperanillo (which is my fave type of wine) and it was excellent. Definitely pricey at $16 a glass, but worth it. 

Now for the food. I would have given this place 5 stars, but i did get sick. I had the caesar salad to start, and it was very good. There are real anchovies in it (which, i&#39;m not going to lie, might have been the culprit that made me sick because i am allergic to shellfish). 
For the entree, i had the hangar steak. It was really good, not great. However, they did cook it exactly how i wanted - well done (i know). 
For the dessert, i had the chocolate pudding. Again, it was good, but not great. 

I would, of course, recommend because even though i got sick (i don&#39;t know what it was from), it is a great dining experience and the service was great.",1
"Just had it for a quick dinner tonight. Me and my bf were tempted in by the 2 for $20 deal. Let&#39;s just say, you get what you paid for. 

Our dinner resulted in both of us taking frequent trips to the bathroom, with his...movements involving the color green. Which was strange seeing as he ordered the 3 Cheese Chicken Penne. I ordered the overcooked Bacon Cheese Burger. The Boneless Chicken appetizer was the best out of the meal and the penne was decent. I mean it really just boils down to the poisonous (cheap) food because we were seated immediately and the service was good.

My stomach is still writhing in pain so heed my advice and AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST.",1
"I must apologize to all the die-hard Shake Shack fans out there but this is just my personal opinion. In-and-Out&#39;s burgers are still much better and you can feed a family of 4 with less $20. Although I would admit that the cheese fries were better. My husband however got sick because the fries were so oily.

The prices are outrageous.",0
"I had a nice night after drinking three beers with friends and stopped off with my girlfriend for a bite to eat before biking home. The staff was friendly and we were seated and ordered right away. We split an order of mozzarella sticks, my lady ordered grilled cheese and fries and I had French toast. It tasted okay; we were expecting dive food and that&#39;s what we got. After eating about half of our meals, we were both overwhelmed by sickness and left immediately after paying our check. Our night felt derailed. Will never go here again. Thanks for nothing, Neptune?",1
"The worst Brazilian restaurant I&#39;ve ever eaten. My husband ordered a medium steak and I ordered a medium well.... We  both got well done, hard steaks that we couldn&#39;t finish. I got really sick of my stomach. I&#39;ll never go back, and won&#39;t recommend. BTW, I am Brazilian, I know my !@#$%^&amp;*",0
"one of the awful restaurants i have ever had. we ordered three dishes there, and they were all oily and flat. my boyfriend even got sick after few hours had their noodles. it was a terrible experience and we&#39;d never go there again.",1
"Ordered delivery from Manetta&#39;s and it was almost as good as eating in the restaurant. Delivery was quick and everything tasted delicious. My usual, the fettucine rosse, was amazing like always. Such a simple dish but oh so flavourful. We also had the shrimp parmegiano, which was slightly fishy, but I didn&#39;t get sick so that is a good sign. Also the asparagus was cooked nicely and gave us our veggies for the meal. Lots of food, but definitely worth saving and having as leftovers later!",0
"You hate home fries? You want hash brown patties! Okay! Have some home fries! .... Oh we made a mistake? Well we won&#39;t fix it because we have better things to do. 

Honestly, I love Igloo.... If they can only get my freaking order right for once!!!!!!!!

Edit: Thanks for giving my husband food poisoning too. Just wonderful... One less star for you now. Come on Igloo!",1
"Boo! The waiter was so rude!! When we had poor service the first time, we decided we&#39;d give the place another shot, but ended up with the same crummy waiter!! He took our orders, 4 different burgers, all ordered medium rare. He brought them all very well done. We let that go. Coors light was on $3 special all day, so we got 4. There was about 30 minutes after getting our food where we didn&#39;t see the waiter. When he finally came back he brought the bill. I asked if he would split the bill by seat. He insisted he could not and that if we wanted to split it, we should&#39;ve told him before the meal began. 
Then, in the fuss of us figuring out the bill, we didn&#39;t realize the rude waiter charged us $6.50 each for the Coors that were supposed to be on $3 special!!! 
The final nail in the coffin: After eating, my husband said he didn&#39;t think his food was sitting well. He ended up getting sick to his stomach for 2 days after eating there.
We will NEVER come back here!!",1
"I liked my cheeseburger. I asked for medium rare, it seemed rarer than I thought it would be. I didn&#39;t get sick though, not yet anyway. Our waiter seemed to be in a bad mood. That&#39;s okay though. Adam ate his cheeseburger quickly and didn&#39;t eat his salad. I didn&#39;t eat my pickle because I thought it would make me thirsty. Adam also did not eat his pickle. After we finished eating he said he was glad he hadn&#39;t eaten french fries.

I wish they had a thing where they left a thing of water on the table. That said the tables were very small so maybe that would have been an issue.

I will certainly be returning to DuMont Burger when it is time to eat a burger with friends!",0
"came here for dinner.

seated in garden.
sick ambiance. 
trees and bushes in the middle of the restaurant.
definitely felt like i was in a park.
roomy restaurant.
nice looking bar.

ordered a speciality cocktail- tasted absolutely horrible. so bad i had to change it. literally tasted like lysol. plus it took 15-20 minutes for it to come.

lamb meatballs- not bad at all. were tasty.

pizza- very average. have had better slices at corner pizza shops.

friend had the salmon- very salty. almost unbearable.

i had rigatoni- very weak. almost tasteless.

overall really nice setting, but food was very bland.",0
"Either I get sick from the food they have prepped or I get hit with an ATM fee at an &#34;authorized Citibank&#34; ATM, something about this place keeps putting me off. 

Just stick to the already packaged food and drinks, walk away with a peace of mind.

If you&#39;re a Citibank customer and used that ATM, check your statements. Call up Citibank and get the fee refunded. Supposedly the location isn&#39;t listed as an authorized location.",1
"The rice balls are amazing I admit.  Well anything fried usually taste pretty darn good.

My beef with this location is the fact that when I ordered the Ragu the inside was still cold.  I am not sure how this could have happen since the cook even used a timer when deep frying the rice ball.

Since I ordered only one rice ball and I didn&#39;t want to be a pain I didn&#39;t complain.  I was hoping the meat was precooked and just ate it.  I know it was partly my fault since I didn&#39;t speak up.

However around 3am in the morning I woke with a case of bad diarrhea.  Any food that makes me lose any sleep is going to get bad rating.

The price here is four dollars for one rice ball.  It is not terrible expensive but it is not cheap either for someone on a budget for so little food.",1
"Never Again!
Let me start by saying that I have no problem with the food at this establishment. I probably wouldn&#39;t get the pre packaged sushi that&#39;s covered in condensation on a Sunday afternoon, but honestly, who would? However I am sick and tired of the poor customer service. I work at a hotel on 44th street and have been going to caf? 45 for over two years now (two to three times a week). At every other restaurant, deli, and pizza joint in the area I will be greeted with a warm welcome (or at least a hello). At caf? 45 I feel like I am somehow a burden to the staff and my ordering a sandwich has in some way wasted their time. This Sunday I was one of two people in the place. They had three guys behind the counter, a woman at the register on her cell, and another guy cleaning the counter. It took them almost ten minutes for them to acknowledge me, let alone take my order. I handed them a written order from a coworker and then gave mine (three times because he was too busy talking to his buddy behind the counter to listen to me). I paid my bill (which was a little pricey for two sandwiches and a bag of chips) and made my way back to work. Only to find that they had added items to the order I handed to them and forgot items on the one I voiced to them. Sadly, this is not the first time I&#39;ve had this happen and honestly it&#39;s my own fault for ever going back after the first dozen screwed up orders. From now on I will be taking my business next door to Ambrosia or to City Caf? on 43rd street. Both of those establishments have never screwed up an order; have a much friendlier staff, and the same (if not better) quality of food. But if you have some time to waste and don&#39;t care if your order is right; this place is right up your alley. If not, I would suggest you keep walking, this is New York and there are plenty of other places to get a bite to eat.",0
"I stopped by this bakery for the second time since it opened by the new owners and I bought a cinnamon roll cigar and a almond roll with custard. I ate the almond roll with the custard the same day (it was good) and the next day I brought the cinnamon roll with me to work so I can have it during lunch. As I was about to take the last bite, I discovered a thick hair sticking out and I got disgusted. It didn&#39;t look human hair, I&#39;m not sure, but it may be cat hair. I can&#39;t believe this has happened to me. I&#39;m sick to my stomach. This is unacceptable. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re careless or if it was just an accident, but really, thick hair? Thank God I saw it, otherwise, I would had eaten it. That&#39;s gross! I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to buy anything from there anymore.",0
"LOVED IT.

I&#39;ve been here a couple of times already. For my main, I order the COMBO A and COMBO C with the O BAY sauce. I never got sick of it, but maybe it&#39;s cause I&#39;m a huge lover for seafood. And for starters, I&#39;ve tried the crab cake which was okay. It was a bit burnt for me. On the other hand, I really liked the catfish basket, mac n cheese and cajun fries. The wait can be long sometimes, but it is definitely worth the wait to try it. 

SERVICES - FIVE STAR
FOOD - FIVE STAR
WAIT TIME - THREE STAR",0
"I like the ambience of this place and the staff is always nice.  The food tastes OK, too.  But I&#39;ve been here a few (3-4) times, and I always get an upset stomach afterwards (stomachache or diarrhea).  So I&#39;m not going to give it another try; there are too many really good places to spend your time and money, that don&#39;t make you sick!",1
I got terrible food poisoning from this place and they said it was my fault!,1
"We  ( 4 people) knew we were in trouble when the waiter brought olives in the cosmopolitan i (instead of putting them in the Vodka. ) He also looked a bit annoyed and surprised that we wanted a fresh drink.  It just went downhill from there.  He screwed up the orders, rushed us through the dinner ( there were empty tables surrounding us), and the food was fair at best.  We went by a good yelp rating because we wanted a good restaurant in that area.  Boy, did we make a mistake- don&#39;t you.  And, my husband got sick from the fried ice cream.",1
"Dont ever go this restaurant. Dirty utensils, ill mannered employees , worst food in Jackson Height. We ate here today and all of us are sick.",1
"DO NOT get sushi there. I got food poisoning from eating one of the pre-made spicy tuna rolls. Apparently, I&#39;m not the only person who got sick for eating sushi there.",1
"I was excited to come here, but extremely DISAPPOINTED when I tried the food. The meat was horrible, i actually had to spit it out and couldn&#39;t swallow. I don&#39;t know where it was from, if it was old or not, but it was the worst meat I&#39;ve ever tried and i love meat! I&#39;ve been to other churrascarias and this was by far the worst.

The salad bar was ehh as were the other foods. Very low quality. I spoke to the manager and gave her some feedback. She didn&#39;t offer to comp by food, although she could clearly see it was chewed and spit out on the plate (sorry!). She offered us a free dessert, but I declined it. 

The worst part was my husband had food poisoning late at night and the next day. Horrible. Will never go back. They need to drastically improve the food.",1
"We decided to try our hand making linguine and clams after getting sick of paying $20+ to get a subpar version at different restaurants. The main problem was finding clams fresh enough for the dish. The last time a friend picked up &#34;fresh&#34; fish at Whole Foods, he had food poisoning. Yelp reviews led us to Rosendo where we got a dozen little neck clams that were on ice. After washing and cooking, every clam popped open and proved to be fresh. 

The place was a little tough to find considering the unassuming storefront and the wrong yelp address. All I remember is that it&#39;s near a Kumon. Man, I hate Kumon haha.",0
Horrrible!!! Do not eat here!!! They served my friend raw chicken and due to the poor lighting we did not realize how uncooked the chicken was until my friend started to feel so sick and i took a picture of the pink chicken. They quickly took our food away and gave us a hard time about it!! Not to mention we had to listen to Pandora commercials the whole tome we ate there. This place is as creepy as it looks.,1
"Located on the corner of Kings Highway and West 7th street this place is a hole in the wall location. Near a few other hole in the wall locations. Their food is below par and the place is not so clean. Just like a lot of places in these parts of town they only take cash(not debit nor credit card) . My friends and i went to this place and we werent satisfied. 
A number of months later i forgot about our experience and ordered take out and was not satisfied with the food. My favorite is eggdrop/wonton combination soup and it tasted weird..like soapy. 

My parents are elderly and live only two blocks away. While they themselves find their food marginal they go there because a) the food is cheap b) the food is &#34;ok&#34;  c) we can walk there and d) mom didnt feel like cooking today. Lately theyve been going often. Mom, dad and grandmom went. It was their 3rd venture there. They ordered different items yesterday. Mom and grandmom got food poisoning however dad was ok. 

I say stay clear of this place. Im surprised its not listed here. I wished there was a way to get it inspected. Its not a clean place but most hole int he wall places arent and ive been to places that arent &#34;clean&#34; looking and repeatedy gone to those for years consistently and never ever gotten sick from any kind of foods theyve served.",1
"This was awful! We both got food poisoning here, probably from the shrimp that smelled like garbage, the other Items we had were very bad; the crispy orange beef was limp and tasteless, the pork with garlic sauce was too spicy, the pork dumplings, along with the sauce had no taste. But the worst part was the terrible stomach pains the next morning. Think twice about eating here, and then don&#39;t!",1
One of my friends had food poisoning after she got some food for lunch from the hot bar.,1
"Stuffed cabbage had more potato than meat. String beans were mush and inedible. Beats were mush and... Weird. I felt sick after my meal, half of which I didn&#39;t eat. The only good part was that the servers were friendly and welcoming.",0
"Been here twice now, both times unimpressed. Tonight I came using a Groupon, and like others said, they autograt 20% - which I guess is just to save their servers from getting tipped on the groupon price. Not a big deal if you&#39;re ready for it, I typically tip 20% anyway. 

On to the food. Definitely meh. I had salmon and quinoa, which was ok. My husband decided on a chicken dish which was worse than ok. The chicken tasted like it had gone bad, and although he eats most anything without complaint he spit out his bite midway through and couldn&#39;t eat anymore. Confirming our chicken theory further, he was sick to his stomach by the time we got home. 

No more Stecchino for us.",1
"Everything here was delicious!  
The gluten free bread sticks were crunchy.  I would have loved some spices in the bread or some dipping oil or sauce, but they were great on their own.  I bought the flour mix to take home with me.

The risotto was amazing.  The sandwiches were made on great bread.  I was told that they are most famous for their gluten free pizza... but I wasn&#39;t in a pizza mood that day.  They know what they are doing here with gluten-free! 

Get the Black &amp; White Cookie!!! 

I did not get sick eating here - but they do sell gluten-full things, and it is a small place.  Eat at your own risk.",0
"It was my last day in NYC and we were about to go on an 8 hour train ride to Buffalo, and this was a good place to stock up on goodies for our ride. 

I had my order ready:
Everything Bagel with lox cream cheese
Plain bagel with plain cream cheese
Sesame bagel with walnut cream cheese (good choice Ken G!)
Pumperknickel raisin with plain cheese
Cinnamon raisin with blueberry cream cheese

I forgot to mention toasted until i ordered the last one, but it worked out, cuz i think if it were toasted and we didnt eat it right away that it would get too hard.

The bagels were a good amount of chewy and THEY DID NOT SKIMP at all on the cream cheese. in fact, it was almost TOO MUCH! So much that after eating two bagels by the end of the day, i was sick of cream cheese! 

We also got a couple of huge muffins and they had iced green tea bottles too- who knew! 

The guys making our bagels were super friendly. After reading Mike C&#39;s review, i was ready to tip after my large order, afraid the cashier would say something if i didn&#39;t tip! But when i tried to give her a tip, she strictly said &#34;no tip&#34;. She looked so stern, i didn&#39;t argue. 

Tidbit: did u know that bagels with lox is a kosher version of eggs benedict? thanks Travel and Leisure!",0
"So, this is the best proper taco/Mexican place in the NYU area. All that pretentious fusion or Chinese Mexican food can shove it. The guys who work here are wicked nice and work super fast when they need to. 

That said, I don&#39;t think that I have ever had a taco from this place. I have only eaten their tortas, cemitas, burritos, and tamales. The tortas here are superlative. They are super moist and juicy. I usually get the veggie torta, and it really cannot be beat. I also had the lengua before, which was pretty good as well. Tortas are my go-to in all Mexican restaurants, and these are amongst the best. I live in a Mexican neighborhood and the tortas here are generally not as good. 

The tamales are a superb value. For two dollars you get almost an entire lunch. I think that the burritos, especially the veggie ones, can be a bit on the lame side. The cemitas are good, but I prefer the tortas. 

All in all, if you are hankering for Mexican food around NYU, then this place is an excellent option (Dos Torros gave my friend food poisoning right before finals, so beware). Ain&#39;t no reason to go to Chipotle if the real deal exists, and this is the real deal.",0
"The fish is not fresh!!!!!
I went to this restaurant when I was in town yesterday after reading all of the rave reviews, and much to my surprise it was horrible!! From the fish to the wait staff, it is an all around mess. I started with the spicy scallop and spicy lobster rolls that lookes like they were thrown together, and almost immediately after I ate it, my stomach had a very bad reaction. I spent the next 20 minutes in the bathroom and became dizzy. I told the sushi chef that I got sick from one of the rolls and he told me to leave if I didn&#39;t like the food! I asked to speak to the manager and he told me that he was the manager. I have never been treated like this is any restaurant before. Well I left and I will never come back! 
I spent the next day in bed trying to recover from that meal. A word of warning, spoiled shellfish contains bacteria that stays in your body for a while. Only eat sushi at places you trust serve fresh fish.",1
This has to be the worst diner in the city. The staple of any good dinner is coffee and theirs is the worst I ever tasted. Also their fries were served uncooked and tasted frozen. My friends French toasted tasted stale and made her sick. But the final straw was when they had the nerve to charge $7 dollars for plain toast. Never again!,1
food poisoning. :- 0 ====,1
"This time they got me with the spicy salmon. I avoided food poisoning, but only by a hair. I did NOT feel right for 24 hours. I&#39;m done with this place. It&#39;s a shame because I like the girl who works the front, but I won&#39;t give them another shot at my gastro-intestinal tract.",0
"Response to owner&#39;s comment:
Your account of what happened is quite different from mine.  For your information my entire table saw the pork was raw (pink on the inside) and insisted that I sent it back. The pork could have caused food poisoning.  You don&#39;t have rare pork like you do beef.  I was very polite to the staff about the situation and did not disrespect anyone.  You on the other hand may want to display some respect.  No threats were issued.  I wrote my honest opinion on the experience at Hunters.  I see from your response that the food is not the only thing that falls short on quality at this restaurant.",0
"I had high hopes for some comfort food at Petey&#39;s the other day, based on all of the review hype.  I found the burger and all of its accoutrements to be soggy, lacking in flavor, and overpoweringly salty.  And then I was sick to my stomach for the rest of the day.  *womp, womp, womp*

Two stars for the tasty fries and concept.",1
"I would have given this place at least 4 stars couple of years ago but no anymore. This place used to offer great selection of seafood items but no everything is just bare minimum. Often they will not refill popular item unless asked for it. Pushing customer to select cheaper alternatives. 

Recently I went here for dinner on a busy weekend hoping to find great food but I was disappointed with selection. I had to ask and wait for several items to be served at the sushi bar.

Based on food selection this place used to be a place where you can bring a date or celebrate a special concession but now it&#39;s an overpriced Chinese Buffet. Sad, ain&#39;t it?

I used to look forward to come here for Sea Urchin which they no longer serve. Huge disappointment. Both Salmon sushi and Sashimi plate were empty had to ask and wait couple of minutes for it. Rather than refilling most popular items they were just either hoping people would move on or wait till someone asks for it. Crab legs were being served only by request. They would take your plate the back room and bring back couple of legs. I was pretty shocked by this method. It would have been somewhat okay if the crab legs were actually tasty but they were extremely salty. Salty to a point where asking for a second batch will be out of the equation. 

It gets worst. After the disappointing meal I decided that I won&#39;t be coming back here again. My decision was even more justified when I got food poisoning that night. It&#39;s was so bad that I had to get medical treatment. For nearly five days I was feeling unwell. They should feel lucky that I did not file a lawsuit. Yes, it was that bad.",1
It is my must-go place for every time I come to NYC. tum&amp;yum is absolutely my first choice for thai food :)) caz it could heal my home sick symptom of missing thai food. They have an nice smooth original taste!!! And also I love the friendly service from ppl here ... Totally recommend :D xxxx,0
Let&#39;s  start with we both have been sick to our stomachs sine we ate here. I wouldn&#39;t call it food poisoning but more like ill cooked chicken or to many hands touching the food.  For the price I was hoping for a better experience. It&#39;s easy to say we will not be going back or recommending this place. They have many kinks to work out from service to their software systems to being able to served cooked chicken.,1
"Girlfriend and I stopped in here for lunch and were disappointed.  The service was unbearably slow - it took fifteen minutes for someone to take our order, about the same for our server to drop the check when we were through, and I had to bring it up to the register myself because he hadn&#39;t returned to pick it up.  We could see him standing around chatting with the wait staff.  Other tables in my seating area (front near the windows) were also irritated that he was so absent.  

The food was a let down.  I ordered a salad with grilled tuna, my girlfriend had the chopped salad with chicken.  The options looked good on the menu, but were prepared poorly.  My tuna was overcooked, and both of our dressings were remarkably bland.  As other members have reported (I should have read the reviews) we started feeling sick shortly after eating.  

Poor service along with food that falls flat and upsets my stomach means I won&#39;t be here again.",1
"What kind of gourmet place uses hydrogenated oil in multiple components of the cookie?  Honestly I associate that shit with the most mass produced cheap junk you can purchase and apparently that&#39;s the quality of the graham crumbs and butterscotch chips they throw in the compost cookie.  The cookie itself was pretty disgusting.  This place tries too hard and fails on all fronts, from quality of ingredients to texture to taste.  Feel sick after eating it.",0
"Got food poisoning. Never going there again. I wouldnt recommend this place regardless. Service not good. Menu not accurate, they add surcharges on top of menu price.",1
"I&#39;ve never felt so sick after eating lunch. It was one of those super busy mornings at work so I didn&#39;t have time to buy lunch after right before 2pm. Most other options closeby were already out on a lot of their dishes so I decided to give this a shot.

Got the hornado and just shoveled food in my mouth because I was just famished. After wolfing down most of it though, I realized I was parched because it was like eating stale pork &amp; lard bits drenched in salt. I tried some of the potato ball thing and it also tasted like stale grease mixed in cardboard potato.

After I threw out the rest and got up, I literally thought I was going to throw up. Now, I&#39;ve run some pretty brutal college track workouts too soon after lunch but this was the closest I&#39;ve been to throwing up in a non alcohol or food poisoning induced situation. I literally ran across the street and ordered a large fruit smoothie to wash out the taste and prevent my stomach from over churning on me. Because, you know, throwing up at work in FiDi is rather in bad taste.

NEVER AGAIN. especially considering they charged me $8 for throw-up-inducer-in-a- takeout-box, and Adel&#39;s lamb over rice right out my building is only $5",1
"I am concerned with the customer training and the food at Unos. We had a table of 3, it was my mother&#39;s birthday. One of the people at our table ordered a small plate of the Rattlesnake pasta. When it came she was able to enjoy it but when the check came we were charged for a regular sized plate. I asked the manager, Paula, if it was a small plate and she said no. I told her that it was a mistake because we ordered a small plate. I saw her speak to Zenobia about it, but no changes were made. How are we as first time patrons to know the difference between a small and regular sized plate to tell the server before the check comes? When I asked Zenobia if the manager mentioned the plate size to her she said &#34;Yeah, but didn&#39;t hear you say, small plate and I repeated the order back to you, so I didn&#39;t think anything of it.&#34; On top of this my steak was salty and the broccoli was cold. I didn&#39;t mention it because complaints can ruin a celebration. 

Oh and today, both people who had pasta are sick to their stomach like diarrhea and vomiting. 

We won&#39;t be back.",1
"I had their seafood special last Thurs and got food poisoning. I barely made it home, literally! I do not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant, unless you want to be in tremendous pain and throw up for 2 days! 
This place should be shut down because it is not right for someone to want to go to the ER room after eating there. Their food is anything but Cuban - it is not fresh and tasteless. 
Shame on the people who run this joint!",1
"While IHOP being in NYC isn&#39;t anything new, the planned future locations all over Manhattan actually made more giddy than sad. Why? For the fact they would bring a plethora of hashbrowns that New York has never seen. The breakfast epidemic known as home fries will probably never be overturned by the hashbrown haven that is the rest of America, but I was glad to know I could count on them here. Outside of that, I always know I&#39;m in for a sad meal when I am destined for IHOP in NY.

While the good news is that the hashbrowns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ihop-new-york-6?select=zy2D4G9ks84jp0ZD5gTzRQ#k0bVqIfZQFdZJnws2ViXSQ) are fairly consistent with every other location I&#39;ve ever been to, the bad news is everything else is pretty mediocre. I&#39;m not just talking about the small omelettes, dry ham steaks, ploppy pancakes, or uber tough t-bone steak, I literally mean everything else.

Service can be a candid, fun bunch of folks, but on the job front they&#39;re terribly inefficient, often times slow, and not at all attentive during the late night. And when did IHOP become so spendy? Only in NYC of course. Goodbye $5 specials, hello double digit breakfast pricing. Would it kill to have someone wipe the seats down? Sorry, that sounds like I&#39;m asking a bit much.

I would like to believe I won&#39;t be back, but a long night of drinking or hashbrown missing or simply the fact I am in Union Square more often than not may mean I&#39;ll find myself in the halls of IHOP again. I&#39;m not banking on any improvements in the future, but at least there is a hash brown option in the area. (#1)

__________
(#1) I make myself sick.",0
BEWARE.......Just ordered from this place.  the fish was clearly spoiled.  I called to get a new order and warn them they could be getting customers sick.  they refused and hung up on me.  I called back and was hung up on again.  talk about bad food and awful service.  They had their chance.  wouldn&#39;t eat here for free!!!!,0
"I&#39;ve never eaten anything here that I didn&#39;t absolutely love and the gluten free options are amazing. Best fried chicken I&#39;ve ever had since going gluten free 10 years ago (and I think the only fried chicken I&#39;ve ever been able to order at a restaurant)

Those with Celiac&#39;s must always worry about cross contamination and all I can say is that I&#39;ve never been sick after eating here and the staff is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.

This is by far my favorite restaurant in NYC, and probably anywhere!",0
"Pros:

(+) Good variety of smoothie options
(+) Option to have your drink served in a real coconut shell or just a cup
(+) Unique variety of snacks

Cons:

(-) I had food poisoning from their pre-made sandwich in the fridge
(-) Their sandwiches do not have labels, including expiration dates!

-------------------------------------------

If you have a weak stomach, don&#39;t read my review. Still reading? Well you&#39;ve been warned! lol

It was my first time here and I would have given this place a solid 5 if it weren&#39;t for the food poisoning from their sandwich, but I&#39;ll touch on that in a bit. I work nearby and was on my break so I was ecstatic to discover a healthy option. If you want to imagine yourself on an island in this crazy busy city, then you can have your smoothie served in a coconut shell. Ooooh fancy! =) There wasn&#39;t a huge selection for pre-made meals (other than snacks) and since I was pressed with time, I took what was available, a pre-made sandwich with avocado.

I noticed right away that the sandwiches wrapped in clear cellophane did not have a label indicating the type of sandwich, nutritional facts or even an expiration label. There was only a sign indicating each sandwich type. I just figured that they were in-house made sandwiches which explained the non-labels.

Anyways, after finishing my sandwich and returning back to work - about 30 minutes later I had a horrible upset stomach and ended up spending some time in the glorious bathroom vomiting that sandwich up. Ugh! Not a good first time experience at this place. 

I know it wasn&#39;t the smoothie that made me sick because I didn&#39;t even drink close to half of it before having to chuck it. I lost any desire to drink the rest of my smoothie after that experience. I definitely will never eat any of their sandwiches ever again! Would I come back for the smoothie? I haven&#39;t decided yet. The only reason why I still gave this place a 3 was because of the service and the smoothie in itself. But knocked it 2 stars for the bad sandwich experience.",1
"Recently went on a weekend during the height of club goers getting their grub on (around 6:00 am).  Was seated pretty quickly.  Went to the bathroom and it was a disgusting mess.  Smelled like vomit and toilet tissue all over the floor.  This was BEFORE I ate.  

Ordered the corned beef hash with fried eggs and coffee.  My friend ordered an omelette.  The omelette was brown due to the eggs being over-cooked, my fried eggs were over-cooked as well.  The hash were salty and burned as well.  The only thing I enjoyed was the coffee.  I guess they figure hung over club goers don&#39;t care about the quality of the food.

At the end of the meal the waitress asked if we wanted any dessert...at 6:30am, after breakfast?  

Will never go there again.",0
Came here late night Father&#39;s Day and ended up with food poisoning. Was disappointed because this truly was the best sushi in the area.  Was afraid to dine again though. Walking by this establishment gave me the chills until last Sunday.  Gave it a try and didn&#39;t spend the rest of the week sick! Maybe it was a fluke ;-),1
Just putting it out there again how awful and unsafe this place is. People need to know. I got severe food poisoning and had to go to the hospital because of a raw turkey burger they served and they still charged us for some of our food! 0 Stars!!,1
I cracked my tooth on a Shake Shack burger from some ground up bone fragments in the burger.  They are supposed to be  using premium organic beef.  Maybe they should say they are using premium bone fragments instead.  If that wasn&#39;t bad enough both my wife and I were sick to out stomachs 15 minutes later when we got home.  On top of that the burgers have absolutely no taste!,1
"Beware!  we got food poisoning here! I&#39;m not sure if it was the mussels or crabcake This place sounds and looks like fun, BUT drinks are mediocre and very expensive, so is food!  Music is very loud, and usually bad!  Staff is arrogant!  lots of bridge and tunnel clientele.  Save yourself a lot of disappointment and go elsewhere!",1
"This newly open restaurant has trendy decorations and service was excellent. We had the best bonito tofu salad and the entree sets we ordered were all good - tonkatsu, kaisen don, and salmon/ikura don. The wait time for food was slightly long. 
I was going to give Ootoya 5 stars but the following morning I got sick with fever and diarrhea. It could be a coincidental GI virus infection. My husband and daughter were fine.",1
I was really excited to try this place having gone to it&#39;s sister restaurant but was horribly disappointed and horribly SICK.  I had the black bean tacos that were totally flavorless and some of the onion rings which were equally bland (how can onions be BLAND?).  Then I got home and have horrible food poisoning symptoms.  Now sick and disappointed.  Should&#39;ve read YELP first - seems like others suffered the same fate - hopefully I don&#39;t end up in the ER like they did!,1
Received a pretty horrible case of food poisoning from here last weekend. Obviously never coming here again and you should also avoid this place.,1
"I had the shredded chicken ramen and my friend had a bento box. We liked the food, but I became very ill (nausea and vomiting) less than an hour after eating here. Maybe I just had a bad chicken or something. 
The staff was very friendly, portions seemed right for the price, and the restaurant looked pretty clean from what I could tell. Wish I hadn&#39;t gotten sick, I might have come back.",1
This place is amazing!!!  Food is out of this world and the bread basket is sick. Definitely worth the hike from Manhattan and a great place to stop by before or after the US Open.  You could manage to walk from the subway.  Huge portions.  Homemade wine that&#39;s very decent.,0
Came here on a monday to celebrate a birthday with some fam...listen if you work and havin a bad day...go sick and come back when you feel better..it is a poor reflection of customer service when customers see u complaining and looking very disgruntled...anyway besides the bad customer service..the food was trash..i ordered a full rack of baby back ribs and when it finally came 50 minutes later it was garbage!!!!! The meat was way overcooked and dry i thought my teeth was going to break..i def wont be coming back here anytime soon unless its for drinks!,0
"I have quite the soft spot for Asian markets, and I happened across this one when taking a day trip to Queens. While it was a nice flashback to my favorite Asian supermarket of all time back in Seattle, Uwajimaya, it was nowhere near it in quality or selection. A surprise, then a disappointment. But nonetheless, still a good time.

The first thing you will notice about this store, like many other Asian markets, is the strong stench of fish. Many stores will at least attempt to mask this smell, but it was very overpowering in this market. If you have a weak stomach or do not like the smell of seafood, you will not have a good time. Unless vomiting is your idea of a good time. If you have morbid curiosities, you can check out all the live crabs and shrimp out on display, along with the fish that are cut in half and have their guts hanging out in the open. 

The grocery selection is fairly average, and has a bit of everything you could possibly need. Lots of moon cakes were on display, though not a whole lot of other candies/junk foods that I enjoy. Their noodle and produce selection was pretty decent though, and the prices are very reasonable. It is a lot cheaper to shop here than just about any other market in New York City, and I stocked up on some of my favorite foods here. 

Checkout was fast, though the rest of the store was packed. Lots of people who hog up the entire lane, and bump you with their baskets. I couldn&#39;t count the times that somebody rammed a cart into me, or just left a cart full of stuff right in the middle of the lane. And if you asked them to move, they just glare at you until you move their cart yourself. I can see this place being a total madhouse at times.

Would I come back to this store? Not particularly, unless I am in the area. There are many other similar stores in the area I could go to instead, so I may check them out first before coming back. But this store could work in a pinch.",0
"the place tries hard to be a city-style hippy location: serves hookah, exotic sushi, plays Buddha Bar style music, and makes waitresses wear long skirts. 

The food tastes well, but the next day after eating their sushi I had a mild case of nausea that felt like food poisoning. 

The waitresses are the regular, no-customer-service-friendly attitude type. I also love the guy who sits at the front supposedly checking IDs, but really spends most time sleeping (did not bother to check mine). 

Oh the last straw - the prices! Too high! Way too high!",1
"Food was delicious (good noodle, egg, tofu, fried chicken) but I have to give it only two stars because a bad service and we were sick after eating the food.

Here is the story about the service: I ordered the original noodle. When I ordered, I specifically asked if bamboo is included. I told the server that if that&#39;s not included, I would like to add the topping (it&#39;s on the topping list.) The severed said that is included. 

When I got the noodle, I immediately found that there is no bamboo. I asked the server right away before I ate anything. The server said, &#34;our chef never forget any ingredients.&#34; and told me that it must under the noodle. I turn the noodles around to show her that there is no bamboo. She said again, &#34; it must be under the noodles. &#34; I showed her again by stirring around the noodles and turn everything in the bow upside down. She turned around and went to the kitchen. 

She came back with three bamboo. At the same time. She asked me,&#34;are you sure you didn&#39;t eat them?&#34; I said no. She said,&#34; our chef never forget any ingredients, he is sure that he put them. But, we are willing to give you extra.&#34; She left. 

Here is what I wanted to say to the store: the fact is that the chef forgot the bamboo. Period. What do you meant that you gave me &#34;extra&#34;?  That&#39;s not! Because when you served the noodle, you own me the missing bamboo. What do you meant your chef never forget ingredients? You did, today. Why asked me &#34; are you sure you didn&#39;t eat that?&#34; I felt insulted. I called the server right away when I got the food.

Here is about the food poisoned. Both my friend and I were sick 30 minutes after we finished dinner. We ate different things before we Ippudo and we didn&#39;t eat anything after Ippudo. Not sure if it was because the eggs (we at tofu, non-spicy noodles, fried chicken), but both of my friend and I were on the toilet for more than 30 minutes, few times - horrible experience (seriously, that was the worst diarrhea in my entire life for more than 30 years), you will not want to know the details.",1
"I wish I could give this wretched place negative five stars. I ordered the fish tacos last week, and promptly got the worst bought of food poisoning of my entire life. Whatever you do, do not order the fish tacos. I will not venture into this place every again. Be warned!",1
"I think this place is pretty good. I have been here a couple times.

I am happy they have Ceci Cela croissants. I am happy they have Balthazar bread. The interior is nice. The staff is friendly. I think its the best of limited options around this area.

Suggestions on things I think they need to improve:
- Get better coffee. Best to get some good Italian coffee similar to how Maison Kaiser does it. I have been here twice now and tried their regular and espresso drinks and they are not very good.
- Get better meats for sandwiches. The ham and roast beef just seem like deli meat you would buy in a grocery store.
- Get some french, cold drinks. When I see Snapple drinks it makes me sick...I can get that anywhere and they are terrible. I can find more french cold drinks in a regular deli than I can here.
- Turn up the music a little bit and play just french music. I think they were playing some non french music when I was there last time.

If they made these improvements, I would be here often and would give them more stars.",0
"I came for the cupcakes long ago b/c of SATC, but the cupcakes were dry and the frosting was sickly sweet.  It's also overpriced. So 1 star for cupcakes.

Recently a friend hosted a party in which he served Magnolia's apple crumble, which was surprisingly scrumptious.  I went today to try this crumble again and found it cost $4 for a tiny little round tin of it that looked like it had seen better days.  No thanks, love, not today.

1 star cupcake + 3 star apple crumble / 2 = 2 star review.  You're welcome.",0

"I LOVE TIBETAN MOMOS!

I grew up eating this delicious juicy flavorful momos at weddings, birthday parties and graduation parties. At any celebration event!. Haha. 

Whenever I come to New York, I did live here for a while. I always get my momos from here or also Gangjong kitchen right across the street! If you want  juicy Tibetan momos go there! I've tried the others around the area and I'm not impressed. I'm also picky with food. If I tried it once and you fail, I won't come back. Ive tried both places multiple of times and always satisfied! If you like spicy be sure to get the hot sause! 

Most I've had to wait was 7 to 10 mins but honestly, I rather wait for a good hot fresh batch anyways. Eat as soon as possible that's when the juices and flavors will treat your taste buds right! :)

I've tried this new momo stand in Milwaukee,it was nepali style was super excited to try it but was very disappointed and too undercooked it made my friend sick! It was a fail!  So people of new York take advantage of the great momos you get there! cause some people here are missing out!",0
"This place is way over rated. Everything looks old. I ordered the ""special of the day "" corned beef figuring it was fresh. Horrible. The counter person asked me if i wanted it hot. Huh? I said if its the special of the day it should be hot no? With that he walked away,cut the meat,put it on a plate and MICROWAVED IT. DISGUSTING!!!! I said i dont want that and my friend said ill take it. I guess he was trying to be nice. Just got off the phone with him,hes so sick he ran out of toilet paper. That said i looked around at the display case. What kind of a butcher leaves old 1/2 inch thick steaks on display. I ordered hot wings which were not hot,had no taste,and were way overbreaded. Shepards pie was the worst i ever had. The salads(mac,potato,ect) were all old so i past on that. Gotta say the roast beef was the only good thing there. This place was horrible. Ill never come here again.",1
"I was starting to get sick of my typical Thai adventures via Seamless when I walked by Enthaice with my boyfriend one night and we made a note to come back soon. We thought the decor was cute and really inviting. 

So, tonight we finally had dinner and it was delicious!

We ordered the papaya salad, sauteed pork with lime dressing, spicy flat noodles and seafood puffs. Everything tasted fresh with lots of flavor and perfect amount of spiciness. Our waiter/host was super nice and attentive - genuinely wanted to know how our experience was.

We wanted dessert but were too full, so we will definitely be back!",0
"Easily the worst meal I've had on the island in 35 years.  Their tomato sauce is horrible.  We got it on ravioli and it tasted like they just opened a can of tomato sauce added no spices or salt and served it.  Then with the fried calamari I got ""fra diavlo"" sauce which was the same exact tomato sauce,  this time with Tabasco sauce... again with no flavor at all. I took my calamari home and I'll open a jar of Rao's fra diavlo sauce. My daughter had linguine with clan sauce which she didn't eat also because she said it tasted like it came out of a jar... I want even that lucky. 
I honestly don't understand how everyone has not had the same reaction,  unless the chef was replaced or sick. Waste of $100.",0
"I got a mild case of food poisoning from the salmon here. Mild = not requiring a doctor's visit but still pretty unpleasant. It wasn't marked as expired and I cooked it thoroughly.

I still come here when I need to pick up certain groceries because it's so close to my apartment. It's not exactly cheap and I would be here much less if my favorite Korean produce mart on Roosevelt hadn't shut down. 

Just be aware/careful and read all expiration dates particularly on perishable items. And maybe avoid the ""fresh"" fish.",1
"Pretty chill place. Its nice walking into a fairly new bar. Everything about the place was clean. They have darts here with an automated score keeper which I thought was pretty cool. The drink specials were good and so are their regular priced beers. The beer on tap didn't get me sick so that's how I know they keep their stuff clean.

::bathroom alert::
Very, Very happy w/ the bathroom. Clean, smell and amount of toilet paper etc. 

I know I will find my way back here. They are tons of TVs so for sports people I am sure they will flock here. Only downside they don't serve food.",0
"The food there is a disaster. First of all i grew up in china so i know what good chinese food should taste like. I ordered from them four times and every time I was disappointed. I don't know what they put in the food (too much oil maybe?) but it just makes me feel like I want to throw up after some bites (sometimes it does taste somewhat good like that cashew pork but still...). I ordered an eggplant casserole last night. Not only did it taste awful, now I'm also feeling sick. I don't know about their dim sum but I would never set foot in there again.",1
"I live directly across the street from this domino's location - literally a 45 second walk.  I asked for delivery because I was with a toddler and didn't want to leave the apartment with her since she was sick.  

Although the tracker said that my order left the store at 1:05pm, my delivery didn't arrive until 2pm.

When I called the location to inquire about my order, they immediately hung up the phone.  Upon calling back, I waited for 30 seconds for someone to answer and then they hung up yet again.  Calling back a third time, had a 30 sec wait and finally someone answered.

Never again will I order from this location.",0
"I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but every time I order from this place, I get sick.  Not sick to my stomach sick, but like a cold or some kind of infection.  I don't know if someone is sneezing on the food or what.  I literally ordered from them a week and a half ago (after not ordering from them for over six months) and I am now sick with a terrible cold.  

I won't be ordering from them again, especially considering that nothing I have ever gotten there was that good.",0
"Still searching for a good, local Chinese food place. I tried this place once but my stomach's reaction prevents me from returning. Not sure if it was the oil or just a bad batch of seafood but I got sick immediately after I finished eating. I'd love to give them another chance to be fair here, but I am a bit scared.",1
"Glad this place had its grand opening, because I love banh mi! I had their #35 sandwich, and it was pretty good (but not the best). I tried some of the soup dishes my family had, and they were decent as well. Also, they renovated the space really nicely. Definitely worth going to if you're in the neighborhood (especially if you get sick of the food court).",0
"I really had high hopes for this healthy looking cafe. It reminded me of a pret a manger which I had visited in the UK. It was not as good. (Pret a manger are now in the US whoo hoo)

The staff were not welcoming or helpful as it was my husband's and my first time there. The salad was average and the soup actually made me sick,,was greasy and not fresh.  Seating was uncomfortable and obviously made so you won't stay very long. It seems fresh on the surface but when you look a little closer, it's really not. It was also a bit expensive. I'm not saying i wouldn't go back because it seems they did have some quick and easy offerings.  It's just not as good as Pret a Manger.",1
"I've eaten there twice and both times I was dissapointed....the rice was bad, the meatballs yuck, they mix the lumbi and griot spoons, which is bad because if someone is allergic to shellfish they could sick",0
"I enjoy eating at TGI Friday's, but I would avoid this TGI Friday's location. My wife and I were brought to a table, and requested a different table, the lady seating us was rude and refused to give us another table until we got a similarly rude manager to seat us somewhere else after waiting awhile for the two of them to separate a four top into a two top table. (As they couldn't seat 2 people at a four top)

My wife got very sick while eating the food here and had to be escorted out by a different manager (who was very helpful) as she felt like she had been drugged. We have a suspicion that something was done to her food, as the rude lady that sat us grinned and waved at us as she was leaving work for the day.

I would say that out waitress was wonderful, as was the one manager and the front hostess.",1
"i got food poisoning, and everything was super greasy.  pass.",1
"Bubby's brunch is where its at!

I have been craving pancakes for weeks and after a bought of food poisoning my stomach was poised for a down home, good 'ol fashion big breakfast!

Pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Honestly, what more can you ask for. The food comes out astonishingly fast. Be warned, these pancakes are monsters. The hub and I can usually down any plate, but we were honestly stuffed with just 1 of the 2 ginormous pancakes. These guys are heavy yet light at the same time. I dunno how they managed that, but top them with some butter and maple syrup and these are a meal in itself. I came here for the pancakes and I was not disappointed. They hit the spot and even the pancake I had that I took home, was still the same consistently as when it came out piping hot. 

Forget about having room for dessert, there is no way. Must come back just for dessert! But make sure to get here early to beat the crowds. No reservations :(",0
"If it weren't for the green and white umbrella just outside Washington Square's southwest corner (across from Sullivan St), you'd probably miss this little food cart vendor on the sidewalk.  No dirty water dogs here, just freshly prepared indian vegetarian food.  Also, if you're sick of the high fructose corn syrup drink options from the other vendors in Washington Square - take a look at the NY Dosa truck's drink selection and you're sure to find plenty of natural beverages without the chemicals.  This is as good as food cart cooking gets, and the service is always fast and happy to help.",0
"You know those places that serve god-awful, stomach cramp inducing, rat infested food? If you don't, this place is a prime example of where not to eat. I don't care if you've been stranded on an island, don't eat here, unless you want to get food poisoning and die. 

if you're still not convinced, they change prices on pizza and sandwiches as they please. If you're still willing to go here, I swear this sad excuse for an establishment, must be a money laundering scam. 

safe to say- Avoid at all costs.",1
"Just moved to the neighborhood from the Upper West Side, where I was an avid Cafe Frieda goer.  In need of my weekly Mexican fix, I hit up Maya.  

Was on the verge of ordering the Sur guacamole but luckily (thankyouverymuch), my server saved me from the awful yet hilarious scene that would have ensued once I had realized the key ingredient was none other than--grasshoppers.  I settled for the guac with bacon, cotija, and chicarron instead.  Yummy, but bit into a few rock-like chunks of chicarron that hurt my teeth.  

I ordered the slow roasted pork carnitas for my main course while my fiance got the beef short ribs.  Drooled at and devoured everything and proceeded to feel sickeningly full afterwards.  Would recommend but taking a star off for price/value.  

Don't get the michelada here - it's basically a beer with a shot of spice and spicy salt around the rim.  Perhaps I have a different perception of what a michelada is supposed to taste like... Salty, umami, spicy, lime-y goodness and this fell far short.  DO get the Maya with mezcal though.  Absolute favorite part of my meal and a hefty thanks to my server for introducing me to this sweet, smoky goodness drank mm mmm mmmmm.",0
"Quality & service really took a nose dive this past weekend at JoJu.
We ordered three banh mi sandwiches and it took over 30 minutes to complete.

They said they were short staff in the kitchen but from what I see the four were moving in slow motion. You can tell they are inexperienced.

The cashier was quick and tried to help and kept apologizing for the slowness.
The orders came out in random orders and not in order of submission.

A guy way ahead of us was also pissed when several orders came out before his.
we had the same problem, 3-4 trays of banh mi orders that came behind us was served ahead of us.

One of the order had spicy sauce on it and my daughter got seriously sick from it.
So their quality control is lacking too.

My sandwich was filled in the middle only; both ends of the bread had NOTHING but bread!

I am so disappointed with JoJu.

BTW- I dislike their frequent reward card because they have very short expiration date on them. I lost a chance for a free sandwich by days!",1
"Not only is this restaurant bad, but the owner of it is very obnoxious. 
He privately messaged me, saying that they are not taking any responsibility for my sickness. I wish he would spend more time taking care of the restaurant instead of composing long unreasonable emails to customers. Maybe then less people would get sick after eating there!  
I should have gone to the doctor the day of and gotten a proper diagnosis so I could have sued the place. Unbelievable!",1
"This place is poor/OK. But I don't get the extremes either way. If you are giving it 5 stars u r either 1) a friend of owner or 2) a primate who has never had a 5 star meal. If you are giving it 1 star, your expectations are way too high. It is a bagel place. It can only be so good. But it has gotten bad recently. Comments? I agree it closes way too early. Support the neighborhood. Stay up until 8. You'll probably make 25% of your day in those two hours. Pay attention. Orders are often wrong. Consistancy. Depending on who makes your sandwich, you will have either a huge or a tiny sandwich. Be friendly. You are not in Breezy Point. Not everyone is named Paddy Obrien and works for NYFD. Bay Ridge is diverse. Grow up. Turn on the AC. The last time I went there I got full on food poisoning. You cannot have food out on the counter when it is 90 degrees. All said, I find this place lazy, unattentive to neighborhood and I bet it closes within the next two years unless it changes its whole approach.",1
"Unassuming little shop but HELL. YES. You walk in and literally all you can really see are sacks of potatoes on the shelves on the wall, fryers, and a lot of different sauces, which is how it should be!

I always get the smallest size of fries. Trust me! I'm a girl and I feel stuffed after finishing that. The first time I came here my eyes were larger than my stomach so I got either a medium or a large and I felt sick afterwards. Full and happy, but sick from eating 3 pounds worth of potatoes. 
Fries are big and meaty and filling. Plenty greasy, but not swimming in a pool either, which made me happy. My standby sauces are the lemon dill, horseradish, parmesan pepper, and roasted garlic.

My boyfriend swears by the mango chutney and won't get anything else, but it's just not my thing! To each his own!",0
"My most recent visit to Sidecar resulted in terrible distress. The burger with swiss and bacon was dry and made me feel bloated right after eating it. Two other people at the table had burgers and theirs were either overcooked or cold. The fires were too salty and crunchy, like tater tot detritus. And man was I ever sick when I got home. This place was good, no longer good.",1
"I've pimped-out premiere restos in the area like Bell Book and Candle, Kingswood, Wilfie & Nell, Whitehall...and no doubt, those spots are mad sick.  

But De Santos...with its hella naaaahce outdoor garden to chill, draaank, get-ya-eatz-on, style-n-profile...may be the champ.

We tore up:
- Savory tuna tartare with avocado
- Rack of F'n lamb
- Pan seared salmon
- Juicy F'n burger
- Duck F'n tacos
Washed it all down with a nice bottle of Spanish white wine.

Ancillary elements:
- Cozy, romantic, chill interior decor
- Affable handsome waiters
- Uber-stylish affluent patrons
- Beautiful honeys showing off their engagement rings to other jealous honeys

** I keep sayin it, the west village has the dopest restos.  BUT....it doesn't mean YOU deserve to eat here.  Use your Groupon deals somewhere else. **",0
Great experience! Beautifully mastered sushi like a beautiful art   The chefs here are beyond amazing. Everyone who works here is great never missing a beat with anything you need.  The food was out of this world. Although it is a lot to have so many dishes they are all unique in there own way. The upgrade for the wagyu beef is very worth it could have ate 10 of them. Was an unforgettable experience and worth the price for a once in a while treat. The one thing that really amazed me about this restaurant is its toro because everywhere else I've ever had it (other high end places such as nobu and morimoto) has made me sick but not here it is so fresh it's mind blowing. This will be the only place I ever eat toro again. Thank you everyone who works here for the unforgettable and great experience. One tip sit at the bar the table is extraordinary,0
very nice place. from the outside and the whole time i was thinking this is pretty. and the bathrooms! i know it sounds weird but if you go you'll understand why! i've been to many high end places and by far the prettiest the toilet seats have so many cool options although I did not use any next time I may disappear for a while!! They were very accommodated we arrived late because of traffic they took us with no problem and rushed out order of the chefs tasting menu because we had a comedy show to go to after. The food was great everything was good not one complaint except the toro made me sick but all toro besides masa has made me sick so no big surprise. Enjoyed everything definitely want to go again,1
Love the burgers. Great prices. Fantastic delivery. I feel sick the rest of the night into the morning. Still get them.,1
"GLUTEN-FREE people, please BEWARE!!!  I was poisoned with gluten.  (I have celiac disease, so that means I don't just eat gluten-free because it's a new trend.  I get seriously ill whenever I eat it, and have only had a few slip-ups in 10 years of sticking to the GF diet.  I am always really, really careful about what I eat, but this time I only double checked, and didn't triple check).   I ordered GF pasta and Vegan cheese.  The cashier asked ""Do you want the breadcrumbs? They are gluten-free too"" (leading me to believe that he heard me say gluten-free pasta).  The order came out and I ate about 5 or 6 bites and felt a little nauseous.  The mac n' cheese didn't taste that good at all, so I didn't realize that something was wrong (some gf pasta doesn't taste that good).  That's when I glanced at the receipt and noticed it didn't actually say GF pasta on it.  We asked the cashier and he was confused too, because he said he put it in.  The manager came over, apologized, informed us that I had just eaten the regular pasta, and gave us a refund.  The cashier looked legitimately upset over his mistake.  I left crying, and I have been very sick all week.  

If you do choose to eat here and you have a gluten intolerance, TRIPLE CHECK to make sure you aren't being ""glutened.""",0
"Mediocre food, sickly sweet weak drinks, ($9 blood orange margarita tasted just like the $4 slush from a machine) long line for an absolutely filthy bathroom. 
I only go here because you can sit outside.",0
Worst ever.  Terrible food poisoning. Don't understand the positive reviews one bit.,1
This place has a C rating from the NYC Department of Health which is basically disgusting. It is incomprehensible to me that  an institution of this caliber would tolerate a C rating in their dining area. It's just a blemish on the face of the museum and a huge 'screw you' to members. They need to improve because no one wants food poisoning.,0
"Bacchus is a cute little restaurant with a backyard garden, which has one single huge tree that makes the entire yard that much more charming. On a nice evening, my cousin and I were the only people who elected to sit inside since we're introverts. The hostess with a thick french accent came to tell us the specials of the evening. 

The menu was meaty. We made the mistake of ordering too much meat (yes there is such a thing as too much meat).

Appetizers/Tapas

crispy porkbelly (6) - 4 pieces of extremely tender and delishy pork covered by a subtle layer of burnt surface that gives it a nice crisp. Recommended.

marinated king prawns (8) - 3 pieces of king prawns. It tasted a little dry and being the American tool I am, I was hoping for dip to moisturize these suckers with. Otherwise okay.

Before I write about the main course, can you promise not to judge me for choosing so much meat? Oh you won't? That's okay.

twice cooked pork belly (18) - This was unfortunately a star bringer downer. The pork belly was simply too fat and the dish lacked sides to help digest the fat. A good 90% of the pork was just pure fat. Attempt to clean off my plate actually made me sick afterwards. 

beef cheeks braised in red wine (19) - Too saucy. The beef itself is nice and tender but everything on the plate was drowned in sauce that all the ingredients started to just taste like the sauce. I would have preferred to have my vegetables untampered to down this dish easier.

The service, atmosphere, and value could have easily carried this restaurant to a four stars. Unfortunately, both entrees were just not up to my personal taste. 

Don't worry Brooklyn, I'll be in this neighborhood quite often now so I'll give you guys another shot.",1
"If I were a pig and took a bite of this sandwich, I think I would have to keep chewing- full knowing that it is in fact pig that I'm eating. That's how good it is.

So why not 5 stars? Well, I didn't actually go here. Someone else picked up take out for me. So I am reserving judgment on decor and service until I return, which will happen as soon as my arteries forgive me.

As for the desserts, they are pretty sick as well. The bacon caramels are so rich I couldn't decide if I was experiencing bliss or disgust. The brownie is a solid good. But the belles of the ball for me were the hazelnut cream cookies. 

And yes, I feel like Jabba the Hutt right now.",0
"I have been here twice now and each time was outstanding. This is the first restaurant that always comes to mind when I want a fresh meal I won't feel sick about afterwards. Too bad you to think about wanting to eat here weeks in advance if you want a reservation. But that's what happens when you want to go to an fantastic restaurant. 

ABC Kitchen is connected to ABC Home (which is a great store to waste 3 hours in on a lazy Sunday). And is also decorated with the ABC Home furnishings which makes for a beautiful setting. The menu is ever-changing and is local, organic, fresh farm-to-table affair.

Then entrees I have tried:
-Crab toast with lemon aioli: a must!!!!! amazing flavors and so fresh tasting.
-Pretzel dusted calamari: an interesting twist on a classic. Wasn't an absolute stand out, but I did enjoy it.
-House made spaghetti with sugar snap peas, pistachio pesto and lemon chili crumbs: this dish was fantastic, super fresh tasting, ate every last bite.
-Black sea bass with chili and herbs, potatoes and spinach: the fish was perfectly cooked and came in a very light sauce. The dish was tasteful but not super filling, which left me with ample room for dessert.
-The salted caramel sundae: I can't remember what exactly was in this, but it was EVERYTHING you could possibly want in a sundae - including some caramel popcorn which added the perfect hint of salty. AMAZING.

We also had a wonderful bottle of wine picked out with the help from their delightful staff.

great food. great decor. what else could you want.",0
"i remember going a while ago. i had this pasta pocket dish. it was gross. made me sick actually. not food poisoning, its just not my kinda dish. and very expensive. just not my type of place. too bad cuz its really pretty at the bar but wouldnt be worth it a second time.",0
"Just make sure they put 18% service fee on the check, which is common around tourist area. Only they'd still give you a check with tip to write on, and when you scratch, this Mexican waiter'd give you a look. (Excuse me, I live here!) 

Food was okay. By okay I mean it's not going to make you sick, yet nothing special. In fact, a little bland all over. I don't think I'll go back.",0
Finally a buffet that did not make me sick.   This is a modest place with good fresh food.   I'm watching my cholesterol levels and they had plenty of options for me.,0
I too believe that I got food poisoning from the noodles in this restaurant.  This was my 8 or 9th meal from this restaurant and I am completely turned off by the vile slop that I was served.  Been to the Dr. since and......I'm sick for 6 days now. I will never return.,1
"In the passage of my travels in hopes to sustain substance for lunch away from the intense hectic workplace compounded by a volatile day, Wrapido caught my attention.  I was hoping for pita but the cashier suggested a wrap.  At an utter unyielding $6.75 for a Hummus wrap, the breading was extremely chewy with a choice of six toppings.  This wrap was more of a Burrito as it was over stuff and spilling.  I wanted the Hummus taste but the cook preparer asked what dressing for my wrap which was weird.  Why should a Hummus wrap have a dressing to counteract with Hummus?

There are no utensils offered upon furnishing my order.  I used my fingers acting as a spoon to scoop my salsa topping overflowing from the wrap.  It was one giant hogpoge tube of goo. Unable to finish this Burrito knockoff, I felt sick and discarded the remaining contents and left.  It was not the most enjoyed lunch in my Chelsea/ Flatiron tenure.

Seating is minimal.  Service is average.  Behind the dressing counter is a mural of a knockoff famous photo ""Lunch A Top Of The Tower"" by Charles C. Ebbets.  Upon one's entrance the walkway wall is plastered with mammoth words from the menu which makes it confusing and overwhelming to customers when arriving at the order station counter.",1
"First you get the curry.  Then you get the power.  Then you get the diarrhea.  

Cool spot in Jackson Heights.  We tried to go to the place across the street but they don't have biryani anymore and there was nowhere to sit.  Dera looked brightly lit and full of possibilities so we ventured in.  Packed at 10pm, full of kids and families, WTF.  Don't people have to put their kids to bed?  Apparently not.  Bangladeshi servers, with a separate family only area divided by a screen.  Water in tin jars with small plastic cups for each table, upon request.  They took our order.  Then promptly forgot and took our orders again 25 minutes later.  Definitely an authentic taste.  Way too much rice for anyone to eat.  I don't recommend the biryani so much.  It was kind of dry and not so good.  The curry was better but small serving, oily, not creamy.  Mango lassi, as usual, does not disappoint.",1
"This pizza gave me horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I really wanted to like it but it was so greasy and heavy.  I got a slice of artichoke but it tasted like a buttery Alfredo/cream of spinach sauce.  If you like to eat butter by the pound then you'll love this pizza.  Unfortunately I took three bites and didn't eat the rest.  What a waste of $4.50.  Sorry, but never coming here again.",1
"I've lived in this neighborhood for a while, so when I heard a real coffee shop was opening up I was quite the excited little girl. I hurried on over for my first latte a week into it's opening. I ordered a large skim latte. To which the owner of the shop responded. ""Skim- like skim milk? I'm sorry I don't speak Starbucks."" Not only was I insulted, but completely embarrassed for him. Who doesn't understand what Skim is? It's literally in the title of the milk. Regardless, I brushed it off.
I watched him pull the shot for my latte, which clearly was an over extracted and completely uneven shot. Still I have it a go. It was alright- not awful enough to spit out, and the milk covers up bad shots anyhow. 
I thought I'd be insightful and ask what coffee they use for their shots. He responded by a short ""Colombia."" Which definitely wasn't enough for me to understand the roaster, or even which Colombia. So I politely asked if he knew which roaster it came from. He quickly responded ""Yes. I do."" After a literal 1 minute pause, I asked ""Well...are you going to tell me?"" And he quickly again responded. ""No.""
It was mind blowing to hear that. Soon after he asked ""What're you asking for?"" I let him know I work as a barista. He paused again, asking ""What? Dunkin Donuts?"" It was simply too much for me. I corrected him by telling him actually for a pretty successful cafe in Tribeca. 

End result, he is completely unprofessional. Clearly a terrible barista. You think a regular barista who can actually pull a decent shot is pretentious? Imagine one who can't even distribute correctly enough to pull a non-watery shot and is pretentious- it makes me feel sick. Will I go by once in a blue for a latte without giving him eye contact? Yup- sure will. It's my only choice for right now. I'm going to invest in an espresso machine for home.",0
"I'm surprised this Flatiron location is not listed in Yelp.  Soup in hopes to sooth my nausea sickly body was the only substance my stomach can sustain.  One small Manhattan red clam at $4.59 was mediocre as my favorite New England calm chowder was, disappointingly, unavailable.  One small fruit salad at $2.59 was extreme difficult to open the plastic container yet healthy.  Minimal seating is available with a microscopic dinning-in food tray.

Background music is recklessly loud for a soup eatery.",0
"I don't usually write reviews.  Usually, I just sit on my lazy ass as I read, and depend on everyone else's opinions when I'm feeling indecisive.  But this time, I'm on a mission.

I feel like bodega food has always been there for me, through thick and thin.  Whether I'm broke, sick, or just plain lazy, the convenience store around the corner was always there, offering me home cooked food, or at the very least, a damn fine turkey hero.  This one however, stands out from the crowd.

First of all, there's the owner.  Pretty much every single time I've been there, he's working.  1 in the afternoon, 1 in the morning...the man probably works well over a hundred hours a week, deals with demanding irate pain in the ass customers, and still manages to show a shred of kindness and a smile.  Much respect.

Now, onto why I'm really here: The Pork Milanesa Torta.  Breaded pork cutlets topped with avocado, pickled carrots and jalapenos, then the whole thing is topped with a few dashes of Valentina and some Mexican sour cream (the good stuff).  A brilliantly balanced sandwich, by any standard.  And the kicker?  $3 on a roll, $4.50 on a hero (recommended).  And they stay open 24 hours.  How cool is that?

The next time you find yourself underneath those golden arches, awkwardly walking through the drive through and hoping nobody says anything, do yourself a favor and walk across the street to this little convenience store.  Your stomach will be all like ""Hey thanks! Btw, I'm throwing a fiesta tonight and everyone's invited!"" and you'll be all like ""Whatever, it's cool, stomach. I wouldn't be caught dead at one of your lame ass parties.  But it was cool of you to invite me anyway.""",0
"I've been here multiple times. It's a good place, and the service is always friendly and attentive! The meze platters are a RIDICULOUS amount of food. But make sure to note that the price is not $23.95 for a minimum of 2 people, but rather $23.95 PER PERSON. It says this on the menu, but it's easy to make the mistake. Incidentally, they're cash only. But yes, get a meze platter & a tasty Greek beer. You will eat yourself sick.",0
"Tastes good but gets me sick every time. Probably not going again. :( fries aren't so great. Better than mc Donald's but not enough to be called an actual burger spot. 

Plus there are so many options on 30th ave, like burger club two blocks away? A lot of lounges etc ... Just saying :)",1
"Not sure what I just ate that had me sick to my stomach and had to immediately run for the bathroom -.-. 

My fiancé and I were really impressed by Todd English's restaurants both in the airports here in ny and down in Disney in fl. So when deciding on double brunch date restaurant, my fiancé and I decided to come here with the lovely couple. 

We arrived around 11:30 and were seated immediately. We were one of the first parties to arrive for the brunch/lunch rush since the whole restaurant was literally empty. They had an extensive menu which helped satisfy everyone's craving - pizza, noodle, sushi, burger, actual brunch dishes!  Since I was so impressed by previous Todd English's flatbread pizza experience in LaGuardia, I knew I had to get it again. They didn't however have the chicken pesto I saw on the online menu so I asked for their portobello instead. As soon as My fiancé saw the loco moco brunch burger on the menu, he was sold (he is a huge fan of anything with spam). The other couple asked for crispy eggplant flatbread and bulgogi sandwich (after asking about the asada steak taco - our server was honest with his opinion and did not recommend it to us). We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries to share. 

The food took a bit to come out - perhaps a good 20 mins. Around the time our food was served, the restaurant was filled. They even seated a family of 4 to share our table.    The flatbreads were the first to arrive. Comparing my portobello to the cripsy eggplant, I could tell from first glance mine was overlooked and way dry. Perhaps even left sitting around for a bit since the cheese already solidified and hardened. The crust was burnt and did not look anything comparable to what I ordered in the airport. 

The burger and sandwiches took another 5-10 mins to arrive. Both the burger and sandwich were ginormous. My fiancé's burger was stuffed with a nice serving of beef patty, spam, fried egg, and bacon. It also came with sliced green apple and half of a pickle. He was forced to fork the burger since he was unable to take it down in one bite. He didn't even try eating the top bun since it was just too much food. The fries that we shared was just ordinary sweet potato fries (actually I prefer thicker cut) but the aioli that it came with was amazing! i ended up finishing my fiancé's top bun by dipping it into the leftover sauce - so good! My flatbread was as disappointing as it looked. I ended up wasting half of the pizza because I had to tear off all the burnt corner, crust, and pieces. What i ended up eating - the bread - super hard and dry, the cheese was rubbery and old. 

The couple on our double date expressed they enjoyed their dishes. Perhaps I just got unlucky and had too high of expectation? Food, ambiance, and service - overall would had been a 3.5 star experience but minus 0.5 star for its value and another star for food poisoning. :\ .Guess I will spend the rest of my weekend in door by the bathroom now...",1
"The burrito I had (carnitas + black beans) didn't insult my mother or give me food poisoning, so hey, it's still a burrito. I imagine your enjoyment level will be directly related to your inebriation level. 

Pros:
* burrito was sufficiently enormous
* burrito was cheap (less than $8)
* fast service

Cons:
* bland, bland, bland. 
* this place had a B rating from the health and safety board. You deserve better, but if you're like me, you probably won't care. 

2 stars because there's so much better to be had. Make the hike to calexico if you really want a burrito ($$) or, I dunno, try somewhere else ($?)",0
"My favorite pho place in the city! I love their classic beef pho and if I am about to get sick or have a severe cold than their chicken pho is the best medicine. I am also a big fan of their roast pork dumplings. If you are not in the mood for a soup you can always enjoy one of the delicious banh mi with sweet potato fries or one of the really good vermicelli dishes. The portions are huge and the prices are unbelievably low. Only the staff could be friendlier sometimes but it really depends on the individual server. 

During the weeks it is recommendable to be there around noon for lunch as the place gets really crowded and there starts forming a line towards 12:30 pm.",0
"I was in town for an hour, went to Udon West on Yelp recommendations and was sick until the net day.  Salty nasty food.   They do have great service, I will give them that.  Bad Yelp!!!!",1
"Recently had the soft-shell crab appetizer. It was ok.
Didn't taste blatantly frozen. But also did not seem fresh at all.
I'm also not a fan of the hot sake. Do people really enjoy this stuff?

I'm a bit jaded because I recently got very sick immediately after eating here.
Also jaded because the sushi options in Ridgewood are insanely limited.
I'll keep going, but will definitely be a bit more cautious in regards to my food choices.",1
Tasty food and good people watching from their patio but not worth the days of agony from food poisoning from their under cooked poultry. Just barely back on my feet.,1
"Wow, this a shit hole. Two blocks across from Houston street you find this hidden, dark, and smelly place. The first thing the hostess warns you is to beware of pickpockets. When you get inside the men touch you without prejudice, oops. In the bar there are four semi naked strippers where they can be touched for the quantity of one dollar. 
The vodka was the worst I ever drank, too strong, too cheap. There is a sign that says that you can't have sex inside. Gross, dangerous and sick. Never again.",0
"During an very busy 8 day trip to NY, I was so tired of pizza and all the fast food I was eating, I used Yelp to locate a place that made pancakes. After seeing good reviews I decided to walk over and try it out. After looking at their menu and all the choices of what I like to call comfort food, I decided instead to order a cup of the chicken soup and a club sandwich. The chicken soup was delicious and hot and really hit the spot for a ""hot"" meal item after eating on the go for 6 days. The club sandwich was also very good. The waitress asked which kind of break so I went with basic club fixings of plain white break and turkey with bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I asked for a side of mustard and all in all the sandwich made for a nice comfort meal, it was not busy at the time I visited on a Monday and the waitress was very attentive. A gentleman bussing tables kept walking over to refill my water glass and we never had to flag down our waitress since she kept walking by and politely asking if everything was ok. I was so happy with my meal that day I returned for those breakfast pancakes the following day. Breakfast was just as delicious as the previous day and I can honestly say that Red Flame will be a place I eat everytime I'm in NY which will be quite frequently now that my daughter is attending college there. I brought home a menu and have already told my sister she should grab a meal there when she visits my daughter in November! If you are looking for a nice comfortable place to have a good meal that won't break the bank this is the place to eat! Can't wait to go back and order a bowl of the chicken soup on my next visit! I even told my daughter is she gets sick in the winter I will be ordering her soup to be delivered by the Red Flame!",0
"I don't understand why this noodle place is so popular. I tried the Momo Ramen. The noodles here were not exceptional at all (maybe just a tad bit better than instant ramen). It didn't taste that great and the broth wasn't warm enough. It even made my friend feel sick afterward.

The 2 stars is just for the food itself, though. The service is great. The waitress up front was nice enough to remember my name because my entire group wasn't there yet when I arrived, so she prioritized my group later on even though it got really busy.",1
"First off the service was very bad, our waitress said that ""she was the wine menu"" and quoted us at $13 dollars for a glass of wine she later charged us $16 dollars for, we also had to send back an Old Fashioned for being made like a Manhattan, one of our glasses had a huge chip on the rim; Id like to say at least the food was edible but their hamburger made one of the people in our group very sick all night.",1
"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My dad and I were meeting for a quick bite to eat super early in the morning on a Sunday, prior to a shuttle ride to the airport. You would be surprised how many places in this area are closed early Sunday morning that won't give you food poisoning. 

So my dad and I were excited to find a semi-decent looking place that could meet our needs. Except for the fact that this place did not meet our needs, in fact it left us standing on the streets of New York at 7:00am needing to reroute our morning plans because Liberty Diner doesn't feel the need to update their website to the fact that they are not open ""7am-2am Everyday!"" as cleverly advertised on their website.

When I called to question this later in the evening I was told they ""eventually planned to be open at 7am, and that they open at 11am"" Why is this not updated on the website? I ask. ""Ohh we did the paperwork"" I don't know what that means, but what I do know is that if you are not open at 7am, you sure as hell should not be advertising that you are. If they don't care enough about posting the correct dining times on-line, that speaks volumes as to how much they care about the customers, food, and service. 

Liberty Diner take some responsibility and change your times, and advertising. This is literally the equivalent to a 200 pound person, saying that they are 100 pounds and then, when they are questioned on it saying one day they plan on losing 100 pounds, so in the mean time they are telling everyone they are only 100 pounds. Idiots.",0
"If I could give this place ZERO STARS, I would! I have ordered from them online several times and they have miserably screwed up my order. Point in case is this morning. I ordered food and iced coffee and when I received my order, it was completely WRONG! And my iced coffee was not made the way it was supposed to be made and they don't carry soy milk. I ordered waffles with a side of strawberries and bacon. I didn't get the strawberries (which I paid FOR!) and my food came completely cold. When I called to ask for them to redeliver they would only deliver milk and strawberries even though my food was cold. Then I asked for a refund and they refused! This place is completely missed managed and they are racists because this is the 3rd time they have horribly mixed up my order and my friend said she received food poisoning from them after she ordered a burger. 

DO NOT GO OR ORDER FROM THIS PLACE, PLEASE! They don't know what they are doing and when you complain to them, they make it a point to antagonize you int he future if you order from them. The management and employees are HORRIBLE.

BEWARE!",1
Terri I cant deny is good. They hav really cool stuff so when you walk inside you have to kind of calm down and carry on. I will never get sick of the brazillian bombshell mixed with the buffalo chicken sandwich unless i start working here. The smoothie alone can fill you but im a fat pig so waaaa?,0
"Gross.

Just ordered fish tacos and my boyfriend a fish burrito. The fish was old and smelly so we took it out and just ate it veggie. Hopefully we won't get sick tonight...",0
"Food poisoning is for the weak. Ate here plenty of times and never had a problem. Staff is friendly, especially the waiter, Wesley, who is always attentive and made sure we had everything during our meal.Prices here are pretty decent. Do order the Ginza roll. Hey, there's a reason why the restaurant has the same name you know? I have no complaints about this place. Come here if you are looking for a hassle free, casual meal.",0
"Great, affordable frozen margaritas- can't go wrong there! Friendly service. However, the food is not great and made me pretty sick. I only had a chicken taco- fairly bland tasting. Basically, this place is for drinking!",1
"If the only thing wrong here was the lackadaisical service, I might give two or even three stars. But in addition to our waiter being too busy texting to take our order, the food made my children sick.  I'm not saying Walter White is in the kitchen deliberately poisoning children, but the hipster/slacker vibe of this place seems to extend to their approach to basic sanitation. My kids shared an order of mac and cheese featuring several ""fromages artesionelles,"" at least one of which was clearly not stored correctly which resulted in two screaming children at 2 AM, laundry til 5, the next day totally shot for the whole family. But yeah, beyond the (im)practical implications, these people harmed. My. Children. 
So, even if tomorrow isn't the most important day of your life, avoid this place on principle.",1
"My overall experience here was mediocre. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table for two, even though we got there at 4:30 on a Sunday, I was definitely HUNGRY and ready to eat what I thought was going to be the most delicious ramen EVER. However, when I left, I was tempted to just tell everyone in that ludicrously long line that the food simply was not worth it.

Let's start with the good. The noodles are chewy, a little salty (in a good way), and have that fun yellow and wavy look (unlike the straight white noodles you find at Ippudo). Another nice surprise was that the broth is made from chicken, so it is lighter and less greasy than pork based broths. I still prefer pork based broth, but Totto's advantage is that it was rich and tasty without being overwhelming and making you feel a little sickly afterward. Lastly, the miso ramen ($11) comes with a half boiled egg, which is my ultimate weakness...a little package of savory creamy heaven!

Now, on to the not-so-great. First, I ordered the pork topping (the alternative is chicken), which ended up being two small pieces of rubbery pork. They use very lean meat, which they proceed to overcook... Ick! Second, most of the ramen varieties come with only bean sprouts, meat, scallions, and an egg if you're lucky. You have to pay extra for toppings, even the simple ones like nori and corn will set you back an additional dollar per add-on, which I think is kind of tacky. Third, the wait is absolutely egregious. I cannot believe that even showing up as early as 4:30pm did not save me from a 45-minute wait. 

Side note: I also saw a waiter chase down a customer who he thought did not tip enough... Last time I checked, this is a free country, tips are a gratuity not a right, and you get them when you provide good service.

The food was good (by ""good"" I mean 'above average', but not 'great') but the restaurant's too-cool-for-school attitude is so incredibly annoying. The ramen is 100% NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Go somewhere else, otherwise you'll leave Totto kicking yourself, wondering why you just let yourself waste an hour of your life waiting to get a bowl of ""above average"" ramen.",0
"decor: huge place with beautiful high wood slatted ceilings. tons of tvs with various games on, but no sound. wtf. let me repeat that. it's a sportsbar with a bazillion tvs, none of which have sound because listening to shitty top 40s music makes better sense. 

service: super slow. the waitress couldn't give two shits. it's like a slightly upgraded hooters but minus the 80s wigwam socks and $18 cocktails. the latter i guess because its right off park ave south. whatever. upside, the busboys were efficient and with quickness. thumbs up.

food: just terrible. why do you ask how i'd like my burger if you're just going to ignore me? cardboard might taste better than my wagyu beef burger. only redeeming quality is their truffle mac 'n cheese; actually tasty. their hot and spicy margarita was neither. hot wings weren't half bad, but their hot = mild.

two stars because i didn't get food poisoning. hooray!",0
"It just happened today again with the same butcher! This time he stuck out his butt and hit my basket with it as I passed by.

This nonsense happens every two or three weeks; he rushes me, crowds me, bumps my cart or basket, or blocks my way. Why? Ask them. 

The manager Michael knows when I enter the store because he is in charge of security cameras. So when I got good and sick of it I loudly protested today to the butcher. He sarcastically asked how I think he knew I was there and only apologized very glibly after I protested but not when he butted me. 

The manager just stands outside the door and *looks away*. Normally a manager would want to know what I'm protesting about but he *looks away* because he knows the stupid little game. The rare times I hear his voice on the speaker is when I enter; it's like a shoplifter alert but I don't steal and he knows it.

It's a petty childish way to entertain oneself and run a business.",0
"I placed a $50 order. I was vomiting after their food and called the place to try to get my money back. The manager was extremely rude; not only was he raising his voice at me, he even accused me of lying. Is this how you treat your customers?

They're not getting my money ever again.",1
"Lamb skewers have a special place in my heart because i have loved them ever since i learned how to chew. My fondest memories were enjoying lamb skewers on the streets of Dalian, in the cold while my poor mom had to often lick off some of the chili on the spicier occasions. At one point in my adult life, I thought the only thing that would make life perfect would be to find a decent lamb skewer vendor. 

And thus we stumble upon this little cart...

So far, this has been my favorite xinjiang skewer cart outside of China. Yeah.. I went there...i said it. here's why i love them so much. I never got sick from eating there, the prices are stupid low, the flavors are Just right between the amount of chili to cumin and salt...and they are always there... Rain or shine. I love good value in price and consistency in quality... I am sure you do too.",0
"Came for the pork belly (lechon lettuce wraps), stayed for the lobster roll and the cocktails MY GOD, those dark and stormys!  Chocolate cake: sick. Give me another, please.

Great vibe. First time we showed up we came early when there were just a few locals and the owner and chef stopped by for a chat, and gave us a sampling of one of their new appetizers. 

Cool place. Have been twice now and each time they've added something new to the menu. My husband swears by the burger and our friends made a meal of the appetizers. Lots of unusual flavor combos.",0
"This location has pretty speedy service and is convenient if you're grabbing a train.

However, while the cupcakes look great, the frosting is sickeningly sweet, and the cake is pretty standard. I gave Magnolia another try thinking in the years since I'd last been they may have improved the recipe. They haven't. 

It's really just okay overall, but expensive. Four cupcakes cost me nearly $15. In my opinion it's really not worth it.",0
"One of the best open, outdoor food events around all of the 5 boroughs.  I mean literally everything here is slammin.  We ate so much we got sick from it, but loved it anyway.

If you don't try this event at least once, you either hate food or you hate freedom, or both :-)",0
"Been meaning to try this place for a while-highly recommended by a friend. Had the tuna sandwich...good but got TERRIBLY SICK after word.

Also, sage tea was nice.",1
"Considering I'm currently sick from the food, and how the kitchen couldn't get any of our orders right when no one was there, or that the waitress had some serious tude issues..in giving this place a 2. Food was ok, ""rare"" burgers came out well done..when returned none of the previously requested toppings were right. Very slow for food to arrive...I guess because they were busy cooking the rare burgers to a puck. Waitress was a bus-length less than friendly.
I don't know...NYC offers so much more. My stomach hurts.",1
"If basing my time at Buddakan on how my body physically felt while I was there, I would have to give it a 1. I was still hungover from the night before, had walked 6 miles all day, was stuffed on chillie cheese fries at snack time (yes, snack time), and felt like I was going to be sick to my stomach. HOWEVER, despite this, the food was excellent, the service spot on, and the atmosphere unbelievable. I'll break it down. 

1. Service- Minus having to wait in the bar area for our table (what's the point of reservations, i ask?) the area was lively. Due to feeling ill I didn't drink but my friends cocktails seemed beautiful and creative. Our server was wonderful, attentive and explained the menu well. 

2. Menu- Flipping unbelievably delicious. we ordered the springrolls which were steaming hot and amazing, and the rock shrimp. I am obsessed with rock shrimp and this was very good. For our mains we had the Short Rib, chillie chicken, lobster fried rice, blackened cod, caulliflower, and a few other things I can't remember now. All of it was steaming hot and delicious. Special shoutout to the short rib. I polished it off it was so good. My only negative is that the waitress suggested we order 2 aps, 3 mains, and two misc. from the rice and sides. This was way too much food for 3 girls and we ended up only eating half of it. 

3. The Vibe- It was on SATC for crying out loud so of course it's cool but it was REALLY nicely done. New York has nailed the ""concept"" restaurant, and this one did not dissapoint. Large, loud, and lively and not so dark that you couldn't see your food or friends. 

Amazing place, yummy food. 

**1 thing to note. The bathrooms on the upstairs floor are GROSS. at least the ones I used. Communal, and the floor was wet. For a restaurant so commited to looking chic, cool and at over 30$ a plate, I'd appreciate a cleaner restroom that a male didn't just use. There could be other bathrooms I was missing though.**",0
Good food but every time I eat here I get sick :S,1
"Depending on the night, Last Exit might have live music, trivia, 2 for 1 PBR, or something called the Slurring Bee that I really need in my life. 

I'm not fancy though, so I don't need a reason to go drink.

Beer/shot specials, board games and the backyard are enough to get me here (as opposed to several other watering holes on the block), especially since it's on the walk home from the soccer fields at Pier 5...and nobody needs beer like someone who's been running around in the hot sun for an hour (after the vomiting, it's perfection).",0
"Food-poisoning on wheels coming to a neighborhood near you.  
Well, we ate there and had food poisoning. 
Thus, avoid even if its only $6.",1
"I've wanted to check out this place for some time, so when a friend was running late and I needed time to kill, I quickly slipped into here. Patricia C. and I both agree it's a solid 3.5 star rating.

PROS
-Very classy atmosphere
-Dimmed, romantic lighting that makes you feel at peace
-Love the wood paneled walls and inspirational quotes and paintings all over the walls!
-Perfect place to bring my laptop and watch Suits episodes and zone out with my coffee (don't judge me)
-FREE WI-FI!! AWWW YEAHHHHHHHH

CONS
-Pricey (well, they gotta somehow pay for the expensive light fixtures)
-Red Velvet latte was pure sugar to the point where it was sickeningly sweet
-NY Cheesecake was so bland.  Crust was dry, and the middle was not at all impressive.  Still willing to try out their other desserts such as their infamous honey bread",0
"Ok.. I was sick and not feeling right.  Their Pho fixed that..  Went to lunch with my mom, and she knows what to order!  Some kind of sweet/sour salmon soup dish and chargrilled pork lettuce wraps that were really yummy.  And the price?  Even yummier!",0
Ordered here for the first time via seamless and am now suffering food poisoning. Food was good so I'm upset it made me and the hubby sick. Awful.,1
"Now that my gamgam is too sick to make me a bowl of her delicious borscht, this place is a fair substitute (minus the 'made with love' part). In fact, I sincerely hope it was not made with love if you know what I mean. But, the borscht is actually really good here. Good pierogies. Vegetarian friendly! I loved the cabbage stuffed with buckwheat  (kasha) that came with the vegetarian plate - great idea, hope to recreate the recipe at home.

Open 24 hours - amazing!

Great Eastern European comfort food.",0
"I miss the food at Georgia's so often it's sick. Somehow they get the vegetables to not taste like they're good for you, and the ribs and fried chicken to haunt my dreams. Last visit recently was no disappointment-- keep it up guys!!",0
"Just  so you know the 13th Step or ""13 Stepping"" is when you are an old timer in AA and try to pick up/sleep with someone who has less then a year sober. It is NOT when you relapse. 
Maybe if whoever came up with the name stayed in the rooms a little longer they would have understood use of the terms better. It seems pretty clear they were a friend of Bills. Even the circle logo looks like a AA coin/chip. 

So I guess I'll save you a seat.  
A moment for the still sick and suffering.",0
I used to eat here all the time... Then I got food poisoning. Never again,1
"Love the soups! They have so many different flavors, you could eat there every day and never get sick of it!",0
"I embarrassingly have to begin with: I am not a coffee drinker. I add more sugar and milk to my coffee than anyone else I know. If I am in need of a warm caffeinated drink I usually order a super sweet coffee blend at my local Starbucks and feel sick when I finish it. 

That being said. I lived in Williamsburg for nearly a decade and watched (partially participated in) the hipster transformation. Hipsters are coffee snobs and my husband is one of them. Because I know not a thing about coffee I would shy away from any coffee shops. When Gimme! opened on Lorimer my husband (boyfriend at the time) had me go in and get a cappuccino with him. It was heaven!!!  The foam calmed the bitterness of the uniquely smooth coffee and there was no added sugar but it was surprisingly okay. I would get one from time to time and even ventured in there on my own (which I could never do at other coffee shops). 

Fast forward to this year. We have moved from the great city of Brooklyn to San Francisco.  I order Gimme! Coffee online for my husband from time to time and although he has found a suitable coffee we often reminisce over how I nearly became a coffee drinker in Brooklyn. 

We returned to the old hood and ran across the ""new"" Gimme!  I think I was more excited than my husband was and pulled him in to get a cappuccino. The staff were great. I'm always a bumbling fool in coffee shops but they went about there business with no sideways glances. The cappuccino was perfection and we sat for a long time chatting about our days in Williamsburg. 

I don't know if its the sentimental value or the pure perfection of their coffee but Gimme! deserves all the stars in the world. If only they would set up shop in SF......",0
"Their brunch is pretty good, have yet to try dinner. I've eaten here a few times with friends so I got to try a bunch of dishes:

- sausage (can't remember if it was the longonissa or the chinese sausage salad) - not worth trying; my friend got this dish and it looked so sad next to the rest of ours as there wasn't much food on it
- Green mango salad - I liked it, but towards the end of the dish, I got sick of the tangy mango because there was so much of it. I replaced the shrimp with bacon since I'm allergic to shrimp and them gave me a lot of bacon (is there such a thing??)
- Sizzling corned beef hash - must try, close second to the next dish
- Sizzling sisig - must try; this is the dish I got the first time I ate at Pig and Khao and my friends and I all determined it the best one; perfect balance of 

^both of the sizzling dishes are brought out in hot cast iron dishes so you the egg cooks in front of you

Last but not least, you HAVE to get the garlic fried rice. I try not to eat carbs too much (by try, I mean that I really want to eat less carbs, but it's so hard), but this rice is just too damn good. Because of the rice and sizzling sisig (moreso the rice), I give them 4 stars.",0
"I've been coming to 53rd & 6th for years, it's  amazing. Always perfect, quick, easy and delicious. They've added extra carts over the years but I still insist on going to the original. Basically it's the best cheapest good in New York. Love it.

To those posting about the guys being mean.. Maybe you were rude to them or were disrespectful/drunk. These guys are always super nice to me and always have been since day one.

Food poisoning? I think not. You probably put too much red sauce on your platter and that's your own fault.",0
"Food poisoning. Stopped by next day to tell the owner, who proceeded to shout me out of the restaurant. 

Avoid at all cost!",1
"As a loyal upper west sider, I've been meaning to try this place for some time now. It definitely wasn't worth the wait. I'm surprised because I've heard nothing but good reviews but it was truly one of the worst meals I have ever had in this city. Two words to describe this meal: bland and greasy. 

First off, I love me a fried pickle. You're better off going across the street to Brother Jimmy's for these. The fried pickles here were a ratio of 4 parts batter to 1 part pickle. The batter was so thick and greasy, just so gross.

My friend and I split the fish tacos, which were tasteless and super oily. We also ordered fries and the Mexican street corn. Again, the fries were greasy and tasteless. The corn? How can one mess up corn? Well, they can. It was charred cobs covered in Parmesan cheese that was just inedible. 

We each took about three bites of each and were so full and sick. It just feels like a grease pool forming in the bottom of my stomach. My friend and I are ladies who enjoy some booze and greasy food but on our best day/night we wouldn't be able to finish this stuff. 

Other notes: 
1. The waiter stared at us for a solid 5 mins before coming over the get our order. 
2. Someone else mentioned the bad lighting. It is super dark in there, almost impossible to read the menu.
3. 1 star for the cider which was light and refreshing, and much needed to cut all that grease.",1
Got a mild case of pood poisoning from this restaurant after eating here last night.  NEVER AGAIN!,1
"Disclaimer: This is based on a Paint Nite event held here.

They have a nice spacious event space downstairs but a bit dark for painting.  Perhaps the waiter was overwhelmed but I found him unpleasant.  I have never seen amarone by the glass which was delicious.  My second glass (different wine) was served in a glass straight from the dish washer and it was terrible.  So bad that I sent it back and asked for a different one.  Same issue, different wine, warm glass.  I gave up and left the wine untouched.  I didn't feel like getting sick that day.  Based on my limited experience, I wouldn't want to come back to try the food.",0
"Is this a sick joke? My sister and I have been going to Frida for the past year, consistently, and have always had a delicious meal and strong drinks. Today, it was different. We ordered two margaritas and they arrived fifteen minutes later both watery, and weak. For $11 a piece I'm fairly certain we should be feeling some sort of a buzz. Nothing.  We also asked for an order of guacamole. It shows up five minutes later (excuse me but isn't this supposed to be made fresh-to-order) with two chips dunked into the middle of it and almost a quarter of the guacamole missing. Were we just served someones leftovers? Did the kitchen dive into our food before we did? We paid $40 for this mess and left sober and disgusted. We were not offered any sort of compensation for our disappointing meal. We will never be returning to Frida. There are too many wonderful restaurants in New York to waste our money on a restaurant who serves their loyal customers food and drinks of poor, poor quality. If I could give negative stars I would.",0
"I have agree with any of the other posters, this place is inconsistent, at best. While it is nice to have a place that offers coffee and healthier prepared foods in our food desert of a neighborhood, the lack of service and cleanliness are major issues. Just yesterday afternoon (9/11), I had to politely get the attention of the only counter staff in the joint as she was too busy sweeping to notice me (this has happened several times on other visits). When she started to make my drink without washing her hands after sweeping, I asked her if she wouldn't mind doing so. To which she reluctantly did but replied, ""It's not like I was sweeping the floor with my hands!"".  Ok, besides the point...

Then, before serving me she attended to another customer who also got coffee but the milk offered at the sugar bar was sour. After I watched the server make two attempts to find milk that didn't smell funny or didn't curdle from her fridge, I gave up and walked out knowing I wasn't going to get sick today from that place. So sad, I really enjoy their coffee, but I don't think I'll be back after this...",0
"My wife and I decided to try this place out for our anniversary...it was a huge mistake.  The food was mediocre, but for the price, it was terrible.  There was nothing special about the food whatsoever, it lacked flavor and all of the sauces seemed to be 90% ketchup.  The service was also terrible, especially considering that there was ONE other table eating there when we arrived.  The server was pushy about expensive menu items and would disappear for 20 and 30 minutes at a time to go smoke hookah with her friends.  On that note, there were a lot of people smoking hookah inside the restaurant.  I hate to be a pain but isn't that illegal?  I thought smoking in food establishments was made illegal years ago.  
So to reiterate, the food was terrible and the service was terrible.  The atmosphere was nothing to write home about though it was nice to sit outside.  

All of this said, I wouldn't have been inspired to write a negative yelp review but for what happened next.  It took the server way too long to bring us our check, and when she did it had a 15% gratuity included.  There were two of us eating.  I have worked at several restaurants and completely understand why tipping is important, and I also know that it makes sense to include gratuity for tables of 6 or more, because the server can get seriously screwed if the table tips poorly.  However, this is outrageous for a table of two - especially considering how terrible the service was.  Maybe that's why the service was so bad, because the server knew she would get tipped anyways.  

To make the story even better, my wife was up all night with food poisoning from the Mahi Mahi.  

Long story short, I will never go back to this restaurant and I recommend the same for others.  This neighborhood is desperately in need of better restaurants.  This isn't one of them.

ADDENDUM: After a bit of research, I determined that it is in fact illegal to add a gratuity to a table of less than 8 people.  I have already called 311.",1
"Having a serious soy intolerance (not an allergy - this is very different than typical allergy response), I was excited for a bakery that was soy-free and not too far away. Before I went I tweeted them ""Oooo do you have GF, soy-free pop-tarts?! Is there oil in them; if so what kind?"" to make sure there is no soy OR ay type of OIL in the pop tarts. They tweeted me back ""yes! No oil"".

I was really excited and even tweeted a photo and how it was good.

Unfortunately, not long after eating the pop tart I developed a massive migraine and was quite sick.

I believe the ingredient I reacted to was the butter spread product they use, that I now know - after researching to pin down what happened, has canola oil, safflower oil and olive oil.

Weather it was mixed with soy oil or not - I always avoid all OILS when eating out and I never would eat any food with oil in it because I often will get sick after wards. This is why I specifically asked about oil in the pop tarts. If they had answered me honestly I would not have eaten it.  The ingredients did NOT LIST OIL either. They listed something that I didn't know was a ""butter spread"" because it only listed the product name, not even that it was a butter spread. If they had made it clear what it was, I would not have eaten it. If the product has oils in it, it would be helpful if they listed that - the actual ingredients.

The only thing worse than how sick I am is the complete lack of concern on their part. In fact when I came to the bakery to try and talk to them - a physician who was behind the counter, would not give me a chance to speak. Instead he yelled at me and about pushed me out the door!

Then after tweeting the owner I got bad mouthed and bullied by her.

It's very hard to understand how someone who has experienced getting sick from foods they thought would be safe would be so brazen to be nasty to someone who is concerned about the very same thing. Especially after publicly telling me there is no oil in a product, when there are in fact 3 types of oils in it, hidden under a brand name. If anyone should understand the importance of honestly answering a question about ingredients, I believe this bakery should.",0
"When I turned quarter of a century, I decided to ring in my birthday at the elegant and very composed Kumo Sushi. 

Let's be real, I love this place for what it is, an absolute mess. The sushi is okay, don't come here expecting high quality sushi, Japanese food, or great sake for that matter. Sushi comes out by the plateful, sake and beer in pitchers. What I find especially admirable is their ability to control the chaos that ensues from the all you can eat and drink 2 hour show. I had a group of about 25 with me and I can very confidently say that college did not prepare us for what we encountered. We were messy, loud, and some people in my party got sick. Somehow, the servers navigated through the throngs of drunk people to continuously and promptly bring us our food, refill our pitchers, and collect our bill. One disgraceful member of my party got sick right outside of the restaurant, a server promptly brought over a bucket of water, washed the sick into the street, all evidence gone. 

This place deserves 10 stars for tolerating raucous and ""unable to cope with turning 25"" customers. Kumo, you will always have a special place in my heart. I love you for your infinite patience and grit.",0
"Made the mistake of getting my black label burger cooked medium well the first time around.  I like my burger pink and juicy, but lately when I order medium at other places, i get a half mushy burger, and i'm sick of it.

I had to go back a 2nd time to order medium given the great overall reviews.  $26 for a burger and fries is still overpriced, but it's definitely one of the best burgers i've ever had.  The grilled onions have an excellent, somewhat sweet flavor.  Only complaint is that it was a bit salty overall.  Always a good sign when you don't need cheese to make a burger, though.

The fries are standard crispy thin fries.  They give you a ton, so at the least, it's a filling meal.  I much prefer these to soggy steak fries.  Nothing special, though.

If you don't want to wait, go late on a Sunday night (say 9 PM).  Had no trouble getting a table.  On any week night, you'll either wait around 45 min for a table, or have to settle for the cramped bar.  As others have said, they do take reservations.

The service is decent, and they have a nice drink menu.  Atmosphere definitely takes you back in time to a jazz club-like setting in the late 50s / early 60s.  Worth trying at least once, and going back if you get a craving.",0
"Im not a huge fan.  The meats r very greasy and did not feel fresh both times that I tried this place. I still prefer Dos Toros; since they are the same style of an establishment. I never feel sick after eating tacos there!
I dont want to say that it is awful, but the reviews are way overhyped if you ask me!  
I personally have exhausted my allowable visits there!",0
"ok, I havent gotten sick yet but the food we just received and barely ate was at best something you get off a street corner after hours in bombay.  I had the chicken vindaloo which looked like tomato soup, tasted like salty water with hot sauce added to it, and there were 5 small nuggets (quarter coin sized) of chicken and two small pieces of potato in it.  I will give two thumbs up for making the chicken white meat... way to splurge on that....

The vegetable samosas were good, congrats on understanding how to use a deep fryer.

The Channa Masala had no spice to it, it was over cooked

The white rice was excellent.. fingers crossed on that michelin award

Again, we did not get sick, but we were trying to understand how this place got any good reviews on yelp which made us try it.

Last note.. we have had indian food before, from curry hill to Mumbai.. we understand that it can vary greatly depending on the chef, night, size of the moon etc.. but this was a horrible first and last experience.

Sorry for giving a bad review, i understand how hard it is to run a business but this was just too bad to let pass",0
"There is a reason that this is the only place that will have guaranteed seating available for dinner in Little Italy.  Because the food here is terrible.  The only people you'll see eating here are disappointed tourists and people that will soon be spending the rest of their evening and entire next day fighting food poisoning.  The calamari tasted like it was fried in old oil that leaked from an old tailpipe.  The pizza was a pathetic flat depressing pie that tasted of freezer burn and not much else. The grappa I'm currently trying to swallow - swill.  On the bright side, I'm walking out of here soon, so that's one star...and the service was good.  (I feel sorry for the poor people that have to serve this food).",0
"Came here at least 3 or 4 times already and I always get the Honey Glazed Steak that comes with fried rice. I just wished they had a better rating.. They have a C. I usually prefer A's, B's are border line, but C I'm a little scared. In the end I didn't feel sick in my stomach so I hope they get a better rating unless it's the other food.",0
"Got a menu of this place in our mailbox here at the office and sick of Ginza and the hour plus wait for deliver decided to give these guys a shot.  They had a deal where if u order online the first time you get either free Shumai or Edamame.  
   Got the 3 roll lunch special. I like that they give you soup AND salad because like the commercial says and is better than or. The Miso soup was good, not too watery and the salad was very good as well with cucumber and cherry tomatoes instead of just iceberg.  The rolls were decent size and very fresh. Got the Snow Crab Avocado (never saw that roll on a lunch special menu before), Yellowtail Scallion and Spicy Tuna. I would recommend all of them. The free Shumai I chose were also very good with the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely order from them again ven if they are a bit more expensive than Ginza.",0
"Scariest experience ever. I ordered the bone marrow brisket burger and took my first bite and thought something felt really off. I open my burger and find my patty COVERED in PLASTIC. At that point, I felt really nauseous and sick to my stomach just thinking that I bit into that. 

I called the waitress over and the manager came and gave me a free meal and drinks but this is UNACCEPTABLE. How did the chef even cook the burger with the plastic on without even noticing? When you come to a restaurant, you don't come to play health inspector, you come to enjoy a good meal.

The owner and waitresses were amicable but they're really lucky I have such high tolerance for this kind of stuff and didn't dramatize the situation. Regardless, this is CRAZY for a restaurant that's supposedly gotten so many good reviews.

Never coming back here again, jesus.",0
"before i start, i almost feel bad for writing this review but i think that the public and the owners of this Establishment deserve to know of the going on in this restaurant. i came for a late dinner with my wife (it was our honeymoon) and we wanted a nice place to go after our Broadway play our waitress was really nice but really uninformed on the dishes when my wife had questions i think she was new. 
we ordered the pork belly it was grand and spot on the glaze was super flavorful.so after that i figured we would get a bottle of wine to celebrate together. For dinner i ordered the steak and fries and my wife order the bass and fingerling potato's 
my steak came out not even luke warm and was so chewy it tasted like dog food from my experience eating steak it usually melts in your mouth. i asked the server to recook the steak and she took it back they cooked it again it came out warmer but still a little cold. the main problem in opinion is the quality of the meat they order at this restaurant. Steak should never be that chewy unless your buying the cheapest cuts of meat possible. now onto my wife's bass, came out cold as well undercooked she eat none of it. i asked her what the matter was and she said that she felt really sick. when we got home she puked all night until about 4am it was just an awful experience. its not like this place is cheap either with these kind of prices you would think that they would at least serve good quality food. well that's my story of going out to Jacques on my honeymoon. in the end they did not charge us for our entrees but still we wasted our money on the 50 dollar bottle of wine and a waste of time when i could have gone to some were else.",1
The place is pretty clean & not as pricey as other places but I would suggest you stick to the salad bar. It's not very big but every time I order one of their meals I am thoroughly disappointed. All of their shrimp except for the scampi is double breaded andS fried twice. You end up feeling sick.,0
"B*tchy door chic and water downed margarita pitchers. Bartenders/waitstaff were generally friendly but too busy socializing with each other... But the view is sick and the smell of crepes is hypnotizing. Go at least once if you can get in to take some amazing photos, go twice for the eye candy, and go thrice if you're too cool for school.",0
"This morning, I came here for brunch with my friend and got the Artichoke Benedict because it sounded interesting. My friend noted to me that the lettuce tasted ""funny"" but I didn't pay attention because I was hungry from just working out. Now, a few hours later, I feel suddenly sick and have explosive diarrhea. I thought about it and realized this is the only meal where I've eaten something I don't eat weekly in a month (almost everything else I eat is cooked from scratch by me). It feels a lot like food poisoning. I don't know if this is a one-off incidence, but no restaurant should have a passing health inspections rating and give any patron food poisoning. Don't come here. There are better eats in this neighborhood that are cheaper and better quality food.",1
"I came here with a friend. From street view, this was the largest restaurant on the street, with plenty of dark spaces inside for privacy and a quieter atmosphere to catch up on. Of course, as the evening progressed, the restaurant filled up. 

Here are my complaints in a nutshell:

It seems as though there isn't enough wait staff. Yes, it got crowded, but we waited ten minutes just to get carry out boxes, and ended up walking to the cashier just to hand in our bill.

The price was not worth the dishes. There was so much food on the plate, but the presentation was awful, the food tasted home-made, the plates were 'as hot as lava' as the waitress explained (I've never been to a restaurant where I had to be pay special attention to NOT touch the plate). When I say the presentation was awful, the big chicken burrito I ordered had its contents spilled out all over the plate. The rice, cheese, beans, etc. were not in the burrito bread itself. The food tasted very very amateurishly made, I could have made the same meal myself at home. I ate 7 or 8 bites and felt a bit sickened. It felt a bit heavy on my stomach and for some reason, I did feel nauseous.

I asked for a carry out box thinking maybe it would taste better at home. Nope, ate five bites at home, and threw the dish out.

Do not come here.",1
"Husband immediately got sick after eating here.  He asked if there was onions in their  falafel, and the cook said NO.  Husband is allergic to onions, so I think thats why he got sick.   Food wasn't all that great for me, I have eaten falafel all over the world, and this was nothing special. I would try somewhere else that cares about their customers.",1
"Green olives stuffed with lemon. 

That's what I will continuously stuff my face with when I go here, I will fill containers upon containers of these delicious green olives and never get sick of them. Also give me the oldest sour pickles and i'm the happiest camper!",0
"This is the most scary food experience I have ever had. My tale of filth is shocking but true. Even as I think about what just happened to me, I gag a little. Well, gulp, here we go:

""Bugs & Death Threats: a Culinary Experience at Crown""

It's Sunday, Week 2 of the football season. I am ready to pigout with some cold beer and some fried chicken with sides. Yum. I remembered that a new chicken place had opened up that offered delivery. They had slipped a menu under my door this week so I mistakenly decided to give them a whirl. The food looked standard and the prices were fair. I called for a delivery but they dont deliver despite what the menu said. Fine, I won't fault them, they just opened. The horror began when I picked up my order. First the place was slammed with ghetto people yelling and putting on a show. I'm used to this type of thing since I have lived around here for 6 years. But what caught my eye were the flies that were all over the place. I didn't think much till I got home...

When I got home, to my horror, I noticed  there were bugs all over my ""food"". Both flies and roaches. I literally got sick in the bag when I saw the abortion that was inside... Thank god I didn't take a bite or I would have fallen into a shock induced coma. The ""chicken"" was so swarmed with bugs that it looked like a prop from the film Beetlejuice.  Seriously, there were 4 or five visible bugs. I wish I took a picture but instinct kicked in and I ran the ""food"" to trash compactor before I thought to take a picture. 

Taste: So I can't comment on the taste of the food because I don't eat vermin for health reasons. But I assume that living bugs would provide a unique culinary experience. 

Nino provided awesome customer service to rectify the situation. First he cursed me out denying that he has ever seen a bug in the restaurant. Even as he yelled flies swarmed around the pizza like they do around the face of a starving third world child. (that was not PC but necessary)  Then he threatened my life if I was to post this on yelp. Me: ""get ready to be blasted on the net"" nino: ""I'll f*cking kill you if you post this"" me: ""are u gonna refund my money"" nino ""get the f*ck outta here before I kick your ass."" So i guess I am literally risking my life to pass this info along. (Your welcome yelp.) 

Don't worry concerned citizens of NYC, I've called 311. Hopefully they will shut this disaster down. BTW. Kissena diner just 2 doors away has been shut down because of bug/verman issues, so I am not suprised they are having this problem, but they just opened for godsake. The way they dealt with the situation was so unprofessional but may have been caused by the fact that half the people waiting for food canceled their orders as I recounted my experience and asked for a refund. Please if you love your family and do not want your little ones to get the bubonic plague. Don't eat here. Nothing positive to say.

I nominate this unique eatery as the filthiest restaurant in NYC. I would rather eat a shepards pie off the floor of the 1 train before I try their food. All kidding aside yelpers take caution.",0
"This place is disgusting. AND they are fooling their patrons because they display a B for their inspection report, but they are actually ungraded, which means that they have so many violations that they can't get a grade!! Think twice before you buy food from here, unless you want to get sick!

"Fluffy and perfectly baked bagels (tried whole wheat, nine grain, everything......... allllll gooooood) and tried the basic cream cheese, tofu cream cheese, blueberry and strawberry cream cheese.

ALL tasted SO GOOD. I know bagels, yeh, they're not that hard to make and the good ones can be found with like blahblahblah, but with Ess-a-bagel, they always get that portion of cream cheese vs. dough thickness perfect. Unlike some 'good' bagel places where they either put too little or too much (get sick of it or feel too filling in the end)",0
"Do NOT go to this place! We ordered wings (since it was Sunday Funday) and what was brought to us was RAW chicken. We mentioned it to the waitress, who passed it along to the manager, and the response was ""I'm sorry, I hope you don't get sick later..."" Seriously?! Never again.",0
"I don't get what the hype is about this gelato place. They were incredibly stingy in their tastings, offering only samples one-fourth of the amount at other gelato shops. I felt that the two flavors I tried were way too sweet and wanted to try another flavor. I was then told (with an attitude no less) that I was limited to only two tastings. That left a bad taste in my mouth.
I instead opted for a random flavor that I couldn't try. Again, the gelato was sickeningly sweet. The consistency was also more like cheap ice cream and started melting even before I left the shop. I suspect the temperature setting was off. 
Overall, it was a bad experience. Will not go back again. So many more better gelato places to choose from in the area.",0
"My wife and I went here this past Friday after receiving the weekly Yelp newsletter. The reviews were encouraging so we went without a reservation and sat down at the bar. The bartender was friendly, the atmosphere pleasant and service very good. We had the bartender recommend a bottle of wine based on our food choices. The italian sausage appetizer was highly recommended, but wasn't anything special. We ordered the pork shoulder and black & green pasta. The 'pasta' dish was very nice and cheesy, the pork was deep-fried and undercooked. Unfortunately, I had eaten a bite before my wife noticed the raw pork. They cooked it further but my stomach had already started turning. I began feeling ill, asked for the check, pointed out the $40 bottle was $48 on our check, and left. These mistakes happen in the restaurant world, but food poisoning is no joke. A weekend spent in the bathroom, thanks Venturo.",1
"We came in with a party of 20 for a bachelorette dinner, and they had a great back room for a party.  I used Open Table, and the manager was great at being ready for us, and accommodating us as our party trickled in, bit by bit.

Our server Carlos was great to us, and everyone seemed to have a great time.

The first pitcher of margaritas was a bit wonky, and it seemed that a few of the party got a little sick that evening because of it...but both said that sometimes too much sugar does that to them.

BUT--overall, it was a very lovely, easy, group dining experience.",0
"I love the location and ambience of the place. It feels homey. It feels like one of those places that you see in a movie where they would have a lot of regulars, and it's a daily routine for them to go to.

Now why am I only giving it a 3 star? Because the food took forever to come. And I realized it was Saturday morning, and there's a lot of people but come on. It would be nice if our waitress came by to let us know the food was almost ready, etc. To top it off, I was getting over a hang-over too, so it felt twice as long. At first I thought it was just me because I wasn't feeling good, but my friend complained too, that it was too long. So it wasn't me.

Now looking at my situation through the eyes of the waitress, she could've been thinking to herself ""Those two girls look like they're in a bad mood, I'll leave them alone.""

Anyways, I got the Nutella French Toast and it had fruits along with it. The toast itself was good, and definitely they are not greedy with their Nutella. If you love your hazelnut and chocolate, you should get this. As for the fruits, it didn't feel fresh to me. But then again, I am comparing it to the fruits I eat, and I do live in California so I'm glad to say the fruits are better here, which it should be, because it is Cali.

I will be back in NYC, and definitely still go back to Penelope, hopefully when I'm not feeling sick. And hope to give them the 5 stars on my next review.",0
"I like the original Tabata by port, and this one pretty much is the same thing, but with a smaller selection.

I hope they do well, because it's hard to notice them with such a small storefront.  Maybe their strategy is to open up next door to a 2 bros to get customers who are sick of the dollar slices and want some hot soupy goodness.",0
"So I first knew about this place through Yelp's Elite event, and I was so impressed by the wide variety of food and the friendly staff that I decided to return the very next day for $1 happy hour oysters. So I did.

Firstly, Preserve24 is quite the artistic installation. Its concept is evocative of steam punk senses and a shipwreck. There's a giant wrought-iron cage, a piano, lots of steel-grey and wooden elements. So I got a bunch of oysters, and they actually were a bit too briny for my liking, and I ended up feeling a tiny bit sick afterwards. Perhaps too much oyster at one setting? I'm not sure. I would have ordered more food if the prices weren't so prohibitive. Everything seemed a touch too expensive for my tastes - perhaps Preserve24 is fancier than I had imagined it to be. There were also a lot of well-coiffed, well-dressed, well-mannered restaurant staff hovering around - I imagine that - as well as the decor - is what the prices are going towards.

I think Preserve24 would be great for a special occasion, or it might be pretty nice too if I became a regular happy hour go-er and got acquainted with the friendly staff. Otherwise - too pricey for humdrum purposes.",1
"The food was good, but definitely have me food poisoning.  Good atmosphere, but would order differently.",1
"My wife had food poisoning associated with this restaurant on Sept 15.  She got ill there; they did not take to it so good.  She noticed that someone else had been ill in the toilet, too.  We're suspecting it's the meatballs or the side polenta, as the latency was only an hour. 

On the other hand, the food tasted great; the service was great; the atmosphere was great.  We ate the brioche french toast, duck hash, OJ, bacon, and ricotta meatballs.",1
"We went at an ""off"" time on an ""off"" day (Sunday evening, earlyish). That said, there shouldn't have been any issue getting our drinks in a timely manner as the place was quiet. Sadly, the service was so poor, we got up from our table twice to inquire about where our drinks were.

The food was lackluster. I had the skirt steak. Although I'm not sick, it's sitting in my stomach like a rock -- not fun.

This place was super skippable.",0
"I wanted to add, the next day I became violently ill. High fever, severe gastrointestinal distress body aches. I have already had a flu shot so it wasn't flu. The onset was also too sudden and the only thing different In my routine was eating their food. It went away after 48 hrs, which points to food poisoning. I did speak to the manager and he apologized but it never should of happened in the first place. I'm a fit person and if an older or younger person was running the fevers I had; they would of been hospitalized. No joke. I'm a registered nurse and I almost went to the hospital myself.",1
"Had to downgrade. Bought some chicken that had more chemicals than my high school periodical chart. Chicken my eye.  Wasn't even meat.  Screw that. And I am sick of the whole ""put the quarter in the shopping cart"" act although it seems to have its purpose. 
And get MORE cashiers. Come on!    And accept credit card, most Americans run on that loan sharking vehicle.",0
"I got food poisoning from this place Saturday night by an overpriced mozzarella, tomato and pesto sandwich. I felt like I was dying! I will NEVER return to this or ANY Dean & Deluca's again!!!",1
"No.

Dirty looking.

They seated us in a round table with 3 other parties. Fat dumplings with fatty brought inside. It's supposed to be a light CLEAR broth. I'm not supposed to be seeing un purified broth. Sick. Tasty, but sick. Stomachache after.

Hot and sour soup was good, but we were too full from 2 sets of dumplings.",1
"I've been to this place 3 times now and it hasn't gotten better honestly. SOOO much potential though.
1. It's expensive. But it's expected. Near meat packing you expect to drop some dollars. 
2.  The promoters literally attack every sexy girl they find and hold onto them like a sick episode of hoarders. 
3.  Don't wear white or light colors. People will run into constantly and spill shit on you like it's their job. 
4. Good luck picking up girls because it is loud as hell and dark as night. 

Best scenario. Get smashed drunk at your place and take a cab to Marquee. Have at least 150 dollars cash and bring at least two girls to every guy. Finally find Molly because she doesn't mind people running into her constantly. Enjoy.",0
"The first time I came here, I got an everything bagel with olive tofu cream cheese.  It was pretty good, and I really liked the fact that they had olive tofu cream cheese, which many places do not.  The second time I came, they no longer had the olive tofu cream cheese, so I got the veggie tofu cream cheese with an everything bagel instead.  It was pretty good, but it made me very sick.  I do not think I will be coming back here.  It is expensive, the lines are long, and I do not want to get sick again.  There are many other bagel places that are comparable in taste (and where toasting your bagel is an option).",1
"I'm here to declare, to confirm, co-sign, to validate that The Queens Kickshaw has the BEST DAMN grilled cheese in possibly the WORLD. I had the guoda grilled cheese that came in thick, toasted, buttery slice bread, gouda cheese (of course) with pickled jalapenos, GUAVA paste, black bean hummus and a side order of a small salad but a FRESH salad. It was DELICIOUS. No, wait, it was HEAVEN!! I was with my date and was a little jealous that the mozzarella and cheddar grilled cheese she had took away the orgasm I was supposed to give her that night. DAMN. I ain't mad though, because the yumminess of my grilled cheese sandwich hit me in the balls.

We followed it with ginger cream brule, bread pudding, affogato and peach cobbler. I honestly wish I was better at describing the texture, taste and feel of food but I'm not so good at explaining it. If I had to explain the dessert in Laymans terms, it'll be: D-D-D-D-DAMN!!!! I also had an espresso, which is no joke. Not your Star Bucks espresso kids, its as authentic as it gets here.

This place has a very unique look to it. I'll describe it as hipster-chicish. It's cozy, dimly lit with candles at each table, a small bar in the front and all sorts of eclectic music plays throughout the day/night. 90's hip-hop, death metal, 90's pop, music of this era. Interesting. The people who work here are always friendly, with a smile and attentive. Always really nice and don't skip a beat.

Either way, this place is good for all sorts of occasions: Dates, regular hangouts or meetups, quick bite to eat, etc. If you live in Astoria or even if you don't, come check this place out and try the grilled cheese! If you don't love it, then somethings wrong with you. I'm mildly lactose intolerant and trust me, the explosive diarrhea was worth it.",0
"I really loved this place, but I did get sick after eating there, and feel like I had something that must have been contaminated.  Actually, the breading on the fried duck seemed very undercooked, which may have been the issue.  Ultimately, you never want that to occur, but I think mistakes happen, and since no one else has complained about a similar experience, I think it was probably an isolated incident, which is why I am being generous with my rating.

Food was good and well priced.  Service was outstanding--super nice.  I also really enjoyed the beverage menu.",1
"I haven't had barbeque in months after visiting Fette Sau.  We ordered what we thought was only a little, which turned out to be a lot.  Yikes.

We arrived at 12 on a Saturday, which is apparently when they open.  Didn't take long to get our food and find seating inside.

Beef brisket: By far the best of the meats we got.  Juicy, fatty, and flavorful... yum
Pork belly: really dry and tasteless........ surprising
Spicy sausages: meh... that's all I have to say because it wasn't very memorable. 
Baked beans were good but in my opinion had a tad bit too much meat/meat flavor in it.  

As I said, I was sick of meat after this meal, but the beef brisket is to die for.

I wouldn't wait hours for this food though :/",0
"When I use to think of salad bars I use to think of getting food poisoning at Ruby Tuesday.  Them I moved to New Jack City and experienced some of the corner bodegas making fresh salads as you choose the toppings. Then I tried chop't, tossed, Just Salad and Sweet Greens as I am always eating a healthy lunch. 

All those roads led me down this path to the Mecca of salad customization. Their dressings are delicious, their proteins are all fresh, filled with flavor and nutrition.  I actually laugh at the selection at the other places... Fried chicken at chop't? Disgusting. You can tell all of the meats and half of the other toppings at the chain locations are prepared so that they can be dispersed from one location and last in the fridge for up to 14 days!  Gross who in their right mind wants to eat that.  

I can feel the nutrients coursing through my veins as I finish the salad now.  Quit having a boring salad, quit having a boring life. 

Spinach and kale, tuna, falafel, grilled kale, roasted carrots, jalepenos, fresh onion, pumpkin seeds, cherry tomatoes, avocado, quinoa, Bulgarian feta. Miso carrot ginger dressing. 

Who makes these dressings?  My mind is blown.",0
"Yes, it's a hipster spot. But who cares? It's awesome, the bartenders are super friendly (and have awesome mustaches) and the outdoor patio is sick. If you want a chill, hip spot with great seating and good drinks there is no reason why you shouldn't come here.",0
"There are so many reasons why I dislike FiDI, the biggest one being the fact that the lunch choices are so lackluster.  Thanks to Dig Inn, I now have another one to add to the list.

I was stuck at work on a Sunday and was perusing my options.  I had never ordered from here before, and the reviews on here and seamless were good, so I gave them a try.  This is what I got:

- Lemon Chicken
- Braised Beef 
- Un-Fried Veggie Rice
- Grilled Summer Veggies
- String Beans w/ Potatoes
- Spinach & Strawberry Salad
- Roasted Red Pepper w/ Toasted Almonds (salad dressing)

Delivery time was an hour, give or take, and I had to call them -- not okay.  Then, the delivery guy calls me and tells me he is downstairs, so I take the elevator down 40+ flights, walk to the lobby, go outside, and still have to wait for him.  Listen, I get that delivery people don't like to wait for you to stroll down to get your food, but never had I been made to wait that long.

Anyway, the bag is soggy because the sauce and heat made the cardboard container damp, which leaked through to the paper bag.  While I was happy my food wasn't in styrofoam, I had to put paper towels down on my desk as a placemat.

Now, onto the portions: I had ordered the large plate, with an additional side of meat, for an additional fee.  Is it wrong for me to assume that I would get a large plate of my original order, PLUS a separate side of meat??  Instead, what I got was everything I ordered crammed into one continuous container, with the flavors of thing x melding into the juices of y and z.   Oh, and the container ain't that big to begin with, lemme tell ya.  ""$16+ for this?!  Really??"" I wondered, as I stared at my plate (I really wish I had the container to give you dimensions, but think 3/4 of a macbook air).  Not only that, if I didn't pay extra for the braised beef, I would have gotten that amount in the chicken, no?  I would have rather not paid more for some beef (which was too sweet, anyway), and gotten the same amount of food with just chicken.  (Speaking of which, I was imagining a breaded chicken francese-type dish, but it was just chunks of skinless breast that was soaked in lemon juice.  Not bad, but nothing spectacular.)

Now, onto my major problem.  Okay, so fine; I was willing to write the experience off as whatever, since the food was a little better than mediocre, and like I said, my standards for FiDi are low.  HOWEVER, this place made me sick.  Like, literally sick.  Someone in a previous review mentioned they got food poisoning from it, but I chalked it up to a random incident.  WRONG.  Sparing everyone the gross details, I was sick for two days straight with an upset stomach.  I had ordered the dressing to use on a salad later, but ended up tossing it.  

One plus, though.  You could tell they used quality ingredients like they went shopping at the farmer's market (which, reading the above, sounds like an oxymoron, I know).  Judging by the other positive reviews, maybe I was just unlucky, but know this -- I thought that, too, when I read the other food poisoning review.  If ordering from here, realize that it may be a gamble.",1
"Came here last Friday night to celebrate my recovery after being stuck in bed for a week with a fever!  I was so excited because I heard all the hype about the new Applebee's, how fab it was and how huge it was, and their spectacular aquarium with sharks and rays!

Yea... about that,

I really do think they are more expensive than the location on Emmons, not that its so expensive or anything, but that just gives you a hint at how desperate for money they are due to this being in a touristy spot. Anyhoo..

We walked in and were greeted by two SCREAMING hostesses, like honestly what kind of Red Bull have you been drinking all day.  They were just too hyper for my taste.  Like they legitimately freaked me out.  They sat us at our table downstairs at a booth.  

Our teen waiter comes over to give us the menus and he said he would be back in a minute to take drink orders, but I gave him mine at that very instance because I was extremely thirsty. lol

We ordered out meals, and I thought our waiter was having an anxiety attack.  I don't know what happened to him that day, but he was nervous and shaking, I felt so bad.

I was missing my utensils so we asked a different waiter passing by to bring some, and she came right away, A+.

I think they have two managers here, or at least more than one, and once we got our food they were the ones who came over to ask how everything was going so far with our waiter and our meal.

At that point we were alright.

Half way through our meal, I swear they turned the AC on so high that my hair looked like it was blowing in the wind.  We were both FREEZING, like freezing isn't even the word!

It got so bad that I couldn't finish my meal.  So we got a to go box, (which is really annoying and not classy.  Honestly the waiter should take the plate to the back and put it in a box them self, I don't want to finish eating and then have to do that myself, it bothers me.)

Anyway I was freezing, came home sick again, great.

Service was good.

Food was typical.

The space they have is gorgeous.

Am I going back next week? no way.",0
"So it has come to my attention that there is something wrong with the food here. Today was the second time that I ended up throwing up and feeling super sick after eating here. I'm going to rant a lot about this place, so be ready to read!! 

First of all, our group made a reservation for 7:30 pm, but when we got there, they did not have any records of our reservation. We ended up waiting for about 20 mins for them to clear up tables and we were a large group so we had to sit in two separate tables. If you aren't going to honor your reservation, you shouldn't  put that option there. -____-

The first time that this occurred was during the summer before I left for my trip to Asia. I ate the clam cream rice. I shared the rice with my friend because we both weren't that hungry and we just went here to catch up before I left. I ate some of the rice, but half way, my appetite was just gone. After I got home, I felt really sick and started throwing up. 

Today, I had dinner with some of my friends. I ordered the burger that comes with fries. I only ate like 3/4th of the burger and took out the bottom bun because it was WAY WAY WAY too greasy that my bun was soaked in oil and became soggy. I ate like 3 fries and didn't even finish it. At first, my friends and I were excited to get the green tea molten lava cake because I had it before and it was pretty good, but we all lost our appetite after a while and actually forgot about dessert. Two of my friends got the omurice; one with beef and the other with beef curry (they both barely touched their dish). 

When I got home, I felt extremely sick like I wanted to throw up. After a while, i threw up some of the burger and felt a bit better. My friend that also ate at the same place felt sick as well and threw up some stomach acid. 

Not only was the food bad, but their service was pretty bad as well. Someone ordered soda and never got it, but they charged us for it on the bill (ended it taking it off because we told them), we had to ask three times for them to refill our water. We were a pretty large group, so after we payed, two of the workers stood at the opening (since we were sitting in the back) and kept glaring at us. I don't understand why they wanted us to leave so badly because it was obvious no more customers were coming in. 

Overall, the food here is ehhhhh and really greasy, they have a C rating, so I guess that's why I kept feeling sick, and their service is pretty bad. Never coming back here. P.S. I'm really hungry right now after throwing up.",1
This place is very filthy!! I got food poisoning with the green juice! If only I can put no stars I would,1
"I'm in Grand Central daily. A couple weeks ago, I ordered a smoked salmon, cucumber and cream chese mini bagel and it was wonderful. So, I ordered one yesterday for breakfast. It gave me FOOD POISONING!  Beware of this place. I'm still not feeling all that great - hoping it'll get out of my system by tomorrow. Sweats, chils, headache, the runs... upset my entire digestive system. Could happen anywhere, but it happenend here and I feel a responsibility to let everyone know.",1
"We went recently on a Sat night a group of 6 and there was no wait but it was very very busy!  The food is great and makes me feel like I am back traveling in Thailand however on this recent trip I got kind of sick from the food, too much MSG? Really I have never had a bad experience here but if sensitive to MSG you might want to skip it.  I love all the soups, salads, and curries.  Cash only.",1
"I made my final shopping trip to Fairway tonight, where I learned exactly how they keep prices down and do well enough to open more stores and (rumor has it) IPO. They make the cashiers, and all people who work there and touch your food, come to work sick. My cashier was coughing into her shirt and looked terrible. Overhearing her conversation with another employee (while she touched every item of my  purchase) I learned that she had 102 degree temp this morning and 107 last night, but Fairway does not accommodate sick days or even calling in sick. 
So nasty! At least with the subway you can wash your hands when you get where you're going during flu season. How do you wash all the groceries you just bought? I'm not really a germaphobe, but this just completely grossed me out.",0
"I've tried a lot of burgers in my life. I lived in NYC for 7 years and now in San Francisco, and trying different burger joints was probably the foodie trend that I enjoyed the most. But my heart always returns to Paul's. Maybe because it was a few blocks from my dorm when I was a freshmen at NYU. Maybe it was because after being there countless times, I've only been served by the same two waitresses. Maybe because their prices are so cheap. Maybe because they once delivered my order to Soho even though I was under the $10 limit because I was too busy to get up there. Maybe because sometimes you just want a giant, juicy, greasy burger and you're sick of this grass-fed 4 oz house made ketchup bull shit on an english muffin. Maybe because, despite the tourists and NYU students, the regulars there are also cops, firemen, and blue collar New Yorkers who need a real burger. Paul's is burger purity.",0
"I am severely allergic to dairy. I ordered a GREEN burrito on Grubhub and asked them to make it dairy free, and vegan. I got my food really fast. I took one bite and it was a CACTUS buritto with CHEESE and SOUR CREAM. I now am extremely sick and puking because these idiots couldn't follow directions on paper. Also my co-worker ordered the Pueblo Burrito and it had a CHICKEN BONE in it. 

I called the restaurant and told them about the issue and the offered to replace it. UM HI!!! I AM HAVING AN ALLERGIC REACTION!!! I AM NO LONGER HUNGRY!

WHAT THE FUCK! Never again.",0
Bad bad bad... I went during the feast of San gennaro and I thought I picked a good restaurant… I was wrong. I ordered the veal and my boyfriend order the chicken parmigiana. Both were over seasoned and poorly made. 2 hours later I felt Ill and became dizzy. I had food poisoning. I thrrew up all my food. I am so upset that an establishment in littkebitsly sells poor quality food that makes their customers sick… Don't go!!!!!,1
"Bad food that made me and my friends sick and the liquor is pretty much all fake!!! So beware before you order anything other then beer, they do have a dollar beer nice so that's alright",1
The food was completely horrible.  It was all greasy and did not taste good at all.  My boyfriend and I actually got very sick afterwards and were vomiting.  We will obviously never order from this place again.  Stay away!,1
"Where to start...our party of 5 ordered the chicken and waffles, along with chicken wings and mac and cheese. While the chicken was delicious and very soft the waffle itself was subpar. It had little red velvet flavor and I couldn't dictate what everyone had been hyping up. Along with this our waitress was very lazy and didn't even bring out our food but the porters that did were very nice. Once our bill came we saw a $30 tip added to the bill. Seeing as how on their site it says parties of 6 or more will be charged mandatory 20%  gratuity we were very surprised. After speaking to our waitress she said that she will talk to the manager who couldn't manage to walk over herself and explain to us that they go by the gratuity rules outlined on their menu, even though it was a slow night. Oh and after my meal on my way home I got sick. Soco will not be receiving my business again.",1
"Screw J&D's.   Last Friday we ordered pizza and a chicken caesar wrap.  The pizza was bad and the chicken caesar wrap literally put me in the hospital.  I spent 24 hours in the ER with excruciating stomach pain from food poisoning.  Five days later, I am still recovering and on antibiotics.

Stay. Away.",1
"I like this place, but they accidentally gave me someone's leftovers of the same item I ordered. Gross. Hoping I don't get sick.",0
"What can I say about city sandwich.

Lets see, well when I lived in Hell's Kitchen a couple of years ago I remember saying to myself, there's really not a great, affordable little place where you can get a great tasting lunch around here. 

There are a ton of restaurants in Hell's Kitchen but when you have tried everything in your neighborhood and was never blown away, and you're sick of spending too much money on eating out, you resort to having to cook. 

I remember when they first opened I was thinking hmm sounds interesting let me try it. That was it, I fell in love!! 

My sister and I were greeted by the owner chef Michael Gruerrieri , who was so nice and warm and right away gave us free samples of his delicious sandwiches. 

I literary ate lunch there every day until I moved. I wouldn't even know what sandwich to suggest, they pretty much have a sandwich for everybody. Whether you're a meat lover (the Todd was my favorite meat sandwich) a breakfast lover or a vegan/vegetarian (the Dianne is my favorite vegetarian sandwich) you will be satisfied. 

They use the freshest vegetables and most amazing bread ever. 

Also their panna cotta, is THE BEST PANNA COTTA IN NYC HANDS DOWN!!

City Sandwich is worth traveling for !!",0
"Service here is very friendly. Each time I've sat down at a table with my girl, I had a really good experience. Take out counter is a whole other story. I waited 10 minutes to get coffee to go one morning, meanwhile there was only a handful of tables being occupied. It drives me nuts when I make eye contact with an employee standing around doing nothing, and they look away as if they can't help me. You don't deserve your job!!!! The food is a whole different story. Breakfast here is pretty good. Pretty hard to f@*k up a waffle or omelet or eggs IMHO. What bothered me most of all was a burger I ordered. I asked for it medium rare, and it came pretty much raw. Meat was purple and cold inside. Thankfully I didn't get sick. I'll be back, but not for anything other than breakfast and coffee.",0
"Was here last night for dinner and was extremely underwhelmed. I would recommend coming here for the absolutely beautiful decor and the interesting drinks. (I enjoyed the Capri in particular - gin, basil, some sort of peppercorn balsamic, and a grape tomato).

Skip the food. The service was atrociously slow, food came out lukewarm, and I woke up feeling sick to my stomach (not booze-related as I only had half of my cocktail and a sip of my friend's to taste it). The flavor was decent, but small in portion size and not tasty enough to be worth the price tag. Plus risking food poisoning is never worth it. 

To repeat: Skip the food, come for cocktails and ambiance. Order from the bar, not the servers.",1
I've given this location plenty of chances and two weeks ago was the last straw. How does a 10 min wait turn into over 40 min wait and this a carryout order?  The service is terrible and the woman who works there is very unprofessional  workers are young goof off too much and are SLOW in getting orders out.  For their prices that are nothing cheap get authentic Italian pizza. Also got sick from the last order. They seem to be more concerned with filling online and delivery orders quicket,1
"Food was good enough but I got awful food poisoning after eating here. Had the baby greens salad, loaded with shallots and onions (onions weren't listed on the menu), papardelle pasta with tomato sauce and mushrooms. The water tasted and smelled funny. Cool ambiance, but I'm never going back!",1
I don't know that I have EVER had better Italian food. This place is absolutely delicious and their dishes aren't too heavy. Usually I leave an Italian food place feeling sick and bloated but I always leave savior feeling comfortably full and light. I love the lemon spaghetti and the chocolate cake!!,0
"Fifth time is not the charm. It is really something when you come to a place with money in hand and they go out of their way to make you regret it. I can live with lazy, a little rude or apathetic but not being singled out. My friend and I were there and our server was very nice and the food tasted nice. It was 1 and a half hours after we left thinking all is going well when she got sick. She could barely walk and I am not strong enough to carry her. She had to sit on the sidewalk for awhile. She vomited many times. She was repeating that her stomach hurts bad. I knew it was food poisoning. I had that a few times from other places. I don't know what exactly caused it so I will list everything she ate there. She had the bread with the spread, salmon with the black risotto and mushrooms, and a brownie sundae dessert with no nuts. I ate the exact same thing and I was fine. I don't know if the cause was malice or negligence but experienced chefs should know when something is wrong and throw it out and not serve it.",1
"I really wanted to like this place and I have been eyeing it for many months since I live so close.  I have always put it off because of price but decided last night to give it a shot.  We ordered a small selection of a few things.  The pretzel dumplings, the wings and the the bacon pad thai.  After not eating meat for the past few days, I was craving it.  

Everything was very tasty but I felt like I was spending a ton of money on something very similar to chinese take-out.  My taste buds were excited and we ate everything, actually every last possible bite.  This raised some suspicions for me.  

The bill was paid and on the walk home both of us felt uneasy.  Definitely felt sick from the food and so did my partner.  My conclusions dont need to be publicly disclosed.  I dont think I will be returning here other than to go to the bar and get a quick drink.  

After all the hype, I have to say I am dissapointed.",1
"Had a problem here.  I was told by my waiter that they were out of a certain dish so i ordered something else. The owner, who recognized me from previous visits stopped by the table to chat & see if everything was OK.  I asked him about being out of the dish i originally wanted, to which he was surprised. He proceeded to ""yell"" at my waiter & I was served my original request. End of story? I only wish. Later that night i had the worst case of food poisoning ever. Heaving all night. Was it a coincidence? I think not. If i had real proof i would be doing a lot more than just Yelping about it.   BEWARE.",1
"Certainly one of the more suspicious places I've ever shopped in. Case in point, walked in last week, looked in the refrigerated bin up front, espied 7 oz packages of President Low Fat Brie for fifty cents and purchased six. Why, I have no idea why. Sure they had a month left before they expired, but I have no interest in Low Fat cheese. Walked to the back, picked out six Portugese rolls for fifty five cents. At least I knew why I was buying those, they slice open real easy and make a nice sandwich for my two teenagers. Went home with forty two ounces of brand name, slightly bland cheese and six nice fresh sandwich rolls for under seven dollars. That is what East Village Cheese is, a place where you can buy food so cheaply you wonder if the staff goes out on a shoplifting binge every morning before opening the shop. I assume the inexpensive cheese is either flavors that didn't work out or cheese that Food Emporium didn't need anymore of. It's never made anyone in our family sick but we eat it fairly quickly after purchasing it. As to buying cheese that they actually slice, well that's a little more dicey. Consume it quickly. I've bought Stilton and Swiss among others and not had a problem. The rolls in the back are fresh early in the day and are a bargain. I don't mind paying cash so that's not an issue for me. The staff could be friendlier, they're not mean, just somewhat disengaged from their surroundings. Maybe a nine and a half hour day, what seems to me six day a week schedule grinds you down. They should stay open later but then again I like to think they're off somewhere loading up on cheap cheese. Of course I just had a frightening thought. Maybe, just maybe, they're charging the correct price for cheese. Is it possible that as New Yorkers we've so gotten used to getting gouged on everything that Boursin for $1.99 seems like an amazing deal?",0
"Another great craft beer bar, with excellent food. Dogfish Head 90 on tap, wha wha?! If I lived in the city, this would be my spot. The decor here is sick. Old school bar vibe, classy too! They offer up a great selection of craft beers, but I'd love to see more to be honest. Like all the craft beer bars in the area, they rotate the beers. But I think they have a few that are regular year round. The food...AWESOME! I'm getting hungry just thinking about the short rib sliders, sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts. Every time I've gone it's been pretty packed at the bar. But service at the tables was stellar. Our waiter was on top of his game. Never had an empty plate on the table long, and beers kept coming as soon as my glass was empty. I'll definitely be back again.",0
"I am a big fan of Subway and go to a Subway for lunch at least 4 days a week. This location has failed so bad. I felt the need to write in to ""report"" how they are failing on the Subway website. 

Below is what I wrote to corporate:

I almost always get a Veggie Delite salad, or sometimes turn a Spicy Italian into a Salad. Every once in a while when a new sandwich comes out, I will give it a try.

Today I decided to get an Eggplant Parmesan  Footlong and a Spicy Italian Salad. 

The woman that helped me did not use a knife to cut the bread but instead tore it open using her bare hands (no gloves). I decided not to get the sandwich after seeing that and proceeded to order the salad. 

The lettuce was not fresh, and I guess it was rinsed in water in the morning when they put in in the case as it was soggy and dripping. The spinach was withered and most of the veggies were mixed up with other veggies. This is a problem for me as I am allergic to red onions. 

I let her finish the salad, but once I took it home I had to throw it away as there were 2 pieces of onions, and after seeing the withered spinach and soggy lettuce I was concerned that I might get sick from the lack of freshness.

Please please please, talk to this franchise owner. This locations needs to be trained on how to keep the veggies fresh and their workstation clean. Overall food safety training might improve this location alot. However I will not be back to this location. Which is unfortunate as I am in the area alot.",0
"I was excited to try Spur Tree last night. I was trying to look over the fact that it had a ""B"". We say down at 8:15 and there was two other tables in the restaurant eating. Our food took an hour. Starting at 9, at least 4 people  come by to tell us that our food would be out in a minute. About ten minutes, later we asked where was our food. They repeated the found would be out any minute. We asked what had happened and the waitress walked away. Our food finally came, the chicken curry roti was yummy. The sampler was all fried not prepared on site food. The salmon was tasty until my friend got sick within two hours of eating it.  They comped a dessert, the banana bread pudding. Coming from the south, I love my bread pudding. I took one bite and put my spoon down. It was dense stock banana bread warmed up. 

Would definitely never go back! I'll stick with Ms. Lillie's for my Caribbean food fix.",1
"NOT my favorite fro yo chain in the least! i've always sampled their flavors without being satisfied w/ any of the flavors

THIS TIME i sampled the coffee & actually ended up liking it..BUT after purchasing a cup full i was sick of it after a few bites

16 handles just doesn't match up to my favs: yogurtland & pinkberry.. SORRY I'M NOT SORRY",0
"Went to Uva this evening for dinner.  Can't understand how so many people had such great experiences.  Everything we ordered from the appetizer to the main course was bland... it was flat out plain with no taste.  On top of that, my fiance and I are both feeling pretty sick to our stomachs.  What is up with this placE?  Definitely wouldn't go back.  The service was good though.",1
"A lot of these places feel like they need to renovate or ""modernize."" Nunzio's, for instance. Slathered in stucco now, and painted a sickly tinned salmon color.

Not Lee's. And thank God for it. Draft Bud for $2.75 and large bar pizzas for $11. Tile floors, wood paneled walls and ceilings. Etched mirrors. A trophy shelf and an oil portrait of Lee. Or maybe Dickie, the second owner. Jets fans. But miraculous for a quasi sports bar in its unobtrusiveness. Everyone's got a rooting interest, but no one has to yell about it.

Fine calamari with good homemade sauce. Runs spicier than you'd expect. Might need salt. Lots of tentacles. Another small miracle.

The pizza is great. We're also rating for the unimpeachable atmosphere. But the pizza is at least four stars. Cracker crust, but just a bit pliant, and with some actual taste, too. Good, sweet sauce. And the pepperoni are those thick-cut coins that roll up into little bowls when they're cooked. Also flavorful. You always want that kind, but you usually get the sad Papa John's kind. This is it.

(Don't get the fresh mozzarella. Because a, you're cheap and it costs more, and b, this really isn't the kind of pizza for fresh mozz. This is cooked longer and slower, and in that time, the fresh stuff dries out.)

Thank God for Lee's in Dongan Hills.",0
"I rarely get sick but when I do I break an elaborate arsenal, including soup!  After two days of chicken noodle soup I wanted something more interesting, and I found it at Boi.  I mean WOW.  The curry chicken meatball soup was phenomenal both in taste and for how it opened up my sinuses.  I had a bit of an appetite, good sign I'm getting better, so I ordered a small shrimp steamed dumpling as well.  Both were exactly what I needed.  I will definitely order this soup during the winter chill, and you should too.  :-)",0
"Food is great in concept. I have been wanting to go here for several months, but we haven't had the time. 

Our first and only visit: Food looked great & staff was amazing. But, I found a hair in my food, and our whole family has been sick ever since we ate lunch there. Hopefully it was just an ""off"" day for the kitchen staff...",1
"Unfortunately, it's 1am here on a Sunday and my wife is vomiting like a 'mad dog' thanks to this place.  Nice location, polite staff, and the food tasted good on the way down.   I had the chicken tacos, which aren't exactly agreeing with me either (diarrhea),  but the fish tacos are wreaking havoc on my poor wife.   Just a bad personal experience and it's the last time I'll be eating there.",1
"I'm warning you guys against going here if you have a weak immune system. I went there, had a burger, chicken wings and a beer for late night dinner - I got a persistent, sick stomach the very next day. Otherwise, the food tasted average. 

Michigan folks - Don't bother coming here to watch games, because noone else comes here. There were only 6 ppl here to watch UMich v UConn game other night. It's nothing like Bro Jimmy at Union Sq. You will be disappointed.",1
"Kieres diarrea ve a ese lugar 
Not a good place. the food is out all day and is very anti-hygienic. this place is not recommended and gave me a huge stomach ache after eating here. unless you are looking to get diarrhea then you should NOT visit this place or any of there other locations.",1
"Since taking out my wisdom tooth, I've been on a hunt for different kind of soft food for a week. Since I'm really tired of the Chinese porridge, I decided to give Korean Porridge a try. I ordered the kimchi and octopus porridge, to go. It took about 15 minutes to prepare. Each option was about $13-$20. It's on the pricier side, but they definitely have higher quality ingredients. The porridge is thick and very tasteful. It's definitely better than the bland congee (Chinese porridge) that I've been eating. 

I don't think I would come here often since ultimately porridge is not main choice for me. But it's definitely a good choice for the sick days.",0
"Went there last night with my bf, we ordered a pumpkin soup, Basil Moo Shu Roll, Jade Mushrooms and a special bean curd and green vegetables casserole. The soup was basically salted water with pieces of non-tasty pumpkin and non-cooked beans. The Moo Shu Roll was 2 pieces of raw carrots and turnips rolled in rice paper, the mushroom came out like pieces of deeply fried chicken  marinated in a sweet brown sauce and the casserole was mainly massive pieces of bean curd in this same brown sweet sauce. Ebven the brown rice was not tasty, the only good thing was the dressing that came on the poor salad which was few pieces of lettuce...

0 taste, 0 health, we paid 50$ for two + I felt sick after.

I can't believe how it is written ""healthy food"" everywhere (on the website, all over the windows, the menu...). How can such a place get so many good reviews (did you all loose your mind??). This should seriously close down. I am mad that they have such a nice spot on this street. Stop this crap!

One more thing that made me mad : the bathroom was not clean. 

If you really want healthy food, don't go there",1
"Most disgusting wings and nachos I've ever had. Seriously thought I was going to be sick for an hour after trying them. 

Upon arrival the waitress had us do 2 laps around the place while she tried to decide where to sit us. So annoying. Finally we just sat down. But the crowd was so annoying that we actually left 2 minutes before football started because we couldn't stand to be there one more second.",0
"I totally agree with the other poster's comments, ""The tension between the people who work there is so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Maybe business is not going well.   Everyone who worked there seemed compressed and guarded - like they had just been screaming at each other until the door opened.""

I have been here a few times and it is awkward, awkward, and more awkward. I wonder if the staff isn't treated well...maybe the manager is a screamer. Not sure. 

Anyway, the goods...for food they claim is fresh everyday, I have definitely had a few not-so-fresh items (cupcake, slice of cake, cookie). The cupcake was not tender (almost stale) and icing was sickeningly sweet. I've also had a few gritty cookies. I really think they could have tested their recipes better and improved them. The muffins don't look appetizing sitting on the white plates they use....too dark and dry looking. 

I wonder if the ovens and such are just props, because never do I see or smell baking items and I've overheard someone say everything is baked uptown. There is a stack of cake boxes on a shelf that looks ready to go and yet never seems to be touched. The one or two baked items on a large white plate look lonely and forgotten. The heart is missing from Pip's Place. I would not recommend it to a friend or serve their food to company. 

I think I've spent enough here and, as much as I'd like to support a local GF bakery, the food & experience just isn't worth it.",0
"Awesome selection of vegan foods and veggies but I found the majority of the food to be Heavily OVERPRICED.  I went in to grab some Tempeh and they had it but it was over $5, the avocados and several other of the produce seemed really high as well. I was so sick of looking for the Tempeh I would have bought it but the LINE. 

Good god --hire some more people to work there. (1) no one was around anywhere to answer questions. (2) the line was over half the store and most people only had 1-2 items.  

This place is good if you are in a sever pinch, but  whole foods and co-op on 4th street have lower prices.",0
"Adorable place to satisfy my salty or sweet, or breakfast or dinner cravings.

They have daily baked items, fabulous cakes, and a to-go section of salads or onigri.

I bought a small selection of cakes for a birthday and it went over great.  They were the chestnut cake, strawberry shortcake, and raspberry something cake.  I got them for my boyfriend's father's birthday and he loved them.  Pretty much gobbled one slice before the rest of us were able to start digging in.  I had some of the strawberry and raspberry cakes and both were tasty yet light and only slightly sweet (I'm not a big fan of sickenly sweet desserts).

Will be a must do for my next cake need",0
"I got very sick at Flex Mussels. I was up all night beiing violently ill.
I guess when you are a very busy restaurant you don't always insepct every mussel.
But yuk they should have.",1
"When you're sick of paying $2+ for an 8oz coffee and $4 for a scone Benny's Delice is an oasis of tasty, affordable goodies. Small and charming, I love stopping in on early mornings for a pain au chocolate and coffee. So good and refreshingly not pretentious.",0
"Before I had to sit my best friend down and explain to him how much I hated the food and service, he'd force me to have dinner here every other month or so. FOR YEARS. It was a sick tradition. Waiters are often neglectful, and there's ALWAYS a long wait to get seated. Unfortunately, it's situated in a prime location and that's why we would end up returning. As with many other chain restaurants, the only good reason to come is for their happy hour on drinks and appetizers. Their sangria is my guilty pleasure - it comes in three delicious flavors and then served in a huge round glass. It's sweet, fruity, and the only reason I'll tolerate coming here. Fun fact: Because I attended high school down the block, a photo of my chamber orchestra is part of the wall mural.",0
"Not that they needed another five star review, but the donuts are just great. I even tolerated getting sick from my dairy allergy afterwards they were so good. We went here on the morning that we got engaged and so everytime I think about my happy place, doughnut plant is involved.",0
"I came here during Restaurant Week and wasn't very impressed.  I was sold on the fact that presidents ate here.  I ordered the fish (I think it was sea bass?).  It was alright, nothing special.  The dessert was better, which was a lemon sorbet (still not great).  That night, I got sick and missed work the next day.  I wouldn't eat here again.  I think it's overrated; maybe I just had a rare bad experience here.",1
I bought pork shoulder from them yesterday and got food poisoning. I cook it through in the pressure cooker for over 30 min and still got sick from eating their meat! Not consistent with the quality of meat and way over priced! Employee don't use gloves to handle raw meat! Will never buy from them again!,1
"Wow. Tonight was my second visit and it was just as amazing as the first. My fiancé and I split a pizza with ricotta cheese, meat balls, pepperoni and mushrooms. It was SICK. The place makes me feel like I was eating at my nonna's house back in the 80's. Decor and everything.",0
"I thought I would never enjoy red velvet cake after cakeman raven left. I was sick and tired of the crappy service, the weird hours, shop being closed at any time, running out of cake for no reason, no one ever answering the phone, etc. but the cakes were the truth!! Anyway by accident I found this place and wow a smile and hello when I walked through the door...wow. The cakes are just as good as cakeman if not better. The caramel is yummy! I hear cakeman opened a new spot but its to far for me to travel to and I cannot take a chance with crappy service so I will stay with this place...yum-o!!!  Oh and the prices are the same...it's worth it!!",0
"I wish I could say the insurmountable service could make up for the bad food but honestly, it can't. 

Hariri soup - overly brothy with barely any chickpeas. The salad had no flavor and the tomatoes were not fresh at all, and it was overly coated in oil. And the snapper was in much too much broth to be enjoyed. My friend had the chicken tagine and she said there was barely any chicken, mostly chunks of fat. The bread rolls were the only yummy thing and even the olive tapenade was missing flavor. The baklava dessert was a good portion but didn't make up for much. 

I couldn't stand the food and left feeling sick. I understand it's a hot spot so I would go back for the night life but definitely not for the food!",1
"I have been a loyal customer of Juventinos and was utterly disappointed with my experience tonight.  When I arrived with a friend, the place was empty and the owner/manager told us we had to sit in the back of the restaurant, even after we asked to sit in the front near the window. The place was empty most of our meal and we couldnt understand why we had to sit in the way back.  Now my friend and I are two good  looking cats so we took it as some personal knock. 

Food could have been better and Juventino even gave us a complimentary dessert cause we think he felt bad.  I ate the choco mousse because I felt obligated as it came from Juventino himself.  Bad idea because Ive been feeling sick for the last two hours since we left.  

Dont think I will be back as I felt betrayed being a loyal customer and getting tossed in the back. We even had appetizers and a bottle of wine but will not support an establishment as I was treated tonight.  Your loyal customers always come first.",1
"I almost didn't put this review up for fear of humiliation, but I feel I owe it to the greater good.

Here's where we see the limits of Zagat ratings. Placing faith in the 22-point score Zagat awarded Rai Rai Ken, boyfriend and I walked into the store rather confidently expecting a decent, regular-Joe bowl of ramen. Boyfriend ordered the miso ramen, and I asked for the shoyu ramen with corn. Girl tells me there's no extra charge for the corn. We get our bowls and start eating. Ugh. There are some unorthodox ingredients floating in our ramen, and the broth is oily with no depth. My meat is overcooked and tough. As I'm gagging through the food (hey, I was hungry), waitress comes over and tells me it turns out there -is- an extra charge for the corn, and she's adding $1 to the bill. Whatever. 

We leave our bowls half-finished, then figure we'll burn off the bad food by walking home (about 15 blocks away). Halfway through the walk, my stomach starts whimpering, then growling, then churning. I try to ignore it, but finally, I grab boyfriend's sleeve. ""Baby,"" I say, wiping the sweat off my forehead. ""I need a bathroom. NOW."" 

We made about three bathroom stops on that oh-so-painful walk home. Moral of the story? Steer clear of Rai Rai Ken. It's so bad, it'll literally make you sick.",1
"Thanks for brining my my soup tonight Nargila!  

Friendly staff, fair prices for glatt (I've seen glatt go for MUCH crazier prices) and they really know what they are doing with the baba and marinated eggplant.  The chicken and vegetable soup is a great tonic when you're sick, plus the salads always come with a nice warm pita. A great neighborhood staple",0
This place is filthy and smells very bad I honestly do not know how people continue to eat at this Chinese restaurant.  I have been living in this neighborhood for about 10 years and when I first moved here this restaurant was great however nowadays I don't know if it's the new administration or what but the food is horrific I got sick from the chicken and broccoli about a year ago and that is when I stopped eating there.,1
"I have been here a few times and enjoyed it. Pizza and kale was all I ever had. The last time I went I ventured and had the roast chicken and banana tart tatin for dessert. The food was delicious (though the tart was a little dry)...but I got violently ill within a few hours of eating it. I called the next day to tell them. The manager was apologetic but offered no compensation (they only take cash. Had I paid with a card, I could have at least disputed the charge). The manager said he would have one of the owners get in touch within a day or two as they were out of town. Never heard from them again. $$ vomitted down the toilet.

Also, when we got there they had a duo playing live music in the main space, not only was it bad music, it was unbearably loud. The manager refused to seat us outside because they only had a four top which they needed to ""save""...even though there were tons of empty tables inside and there was no rush. They turned away two other couples while we were waiting to be accommodated. Finally another couple wanted to sit outside, so they split the four top so we could all sit (but they did it in a really uncomfortable arrangement so that were trapped in by the other table).",1
"If you value your health, DO NOT EAT HERE. I ordered delivery and it tasted great...however, next morning I was vomiting from food poisoning. My boyfriend had two bites of my meal and he had terrible diarrhea. I called the manager and asked that they please refund my money for the sickening experience and they outright refused, and were very rude and denied it altogether. A horrible experience, coupled with their unprofessional management team. ALTOGETHER THE WORST INDIAN EXPERIENCE EVER. THEY DESERVE TO BE CLOSED DOWN.",1
"This is probably the only place where I can revisit a million times and still not get sick of their food.  Hands down the best ramen I had so far in NY! My favorite would have to be the Akamaru Modern, so flavorful and delicious. Don't forget to add the hard boiled egg, makes it that much better. The pork buns were also really tasty, meat wasn't too fatty which I personally prefer. Despite the long wait, come by and give it a try, you will not be disappointed!",0
"The food is maybe 2-3 stars.  Catfish dish is a skip - not yummy at all.  The catfish was okay, bu tit's served on this bed of noodles with mint and scallions and some kind of pineapple dressing that was supposed to be used to dress the salad along with some key limes...and...yeah.  Didn't work.  $16 to boot for like, 6-8 small pieces of catfish. Pass!  2 stars.

Their roasted chicken or cornish hen was like a very well-seasoned roast bird and came with 2 yummy dipping sauces, and this was the tastiest of the dishes we ordered, but at $21 for a tiny bird...um....not worth it.  4 stars for taste, 2 stars for price.

Their wings?  They were okay, but not anywhere near good enough, IMHO, to be voted best wings in the US (What were you thinking HPost??)  Maybe if I hadn't come to the restaurant after hearing the hype, I'd give the wings 3 stars.

To round out the meal, they have little jugs of tepid water sitting ALL OVER the restaurant - on all the tables, all over the bar, etc - and it really makes me wonder how long they were sitting out.  I found that pretty gross.  The diet coke was $3 and flat - and nobody noticed that we didn't touch it and offer a refund or ask what was wrong.  0 stars!

Finally, something was not right with either the shared chicken/hen OR the wings, b/c both of us got food poisoned.  Had the most horrible stomach pains and bathroom issues at 5AM yesterday, which is what prompted me to write this review.  This has nothing to do w/ spice or peppers b/c we both eat enormous amounts of spicy food...there was something off about the food.  SMH that is just NOT OK. 0 stars!",1
"I gave 4 for my first eat-in experience but I could skip Shokudou lunch set (see photo)

- Shokudou set -
The homemade Yuzu dressing on the salad was refreshing, crispy and tasty. Miso soup was packed with tofu cubes but the deconstructed Sukiyaki, main dish, didn't wow me. It didn't make to come back for more like other dishes, Katsu-sando and Eggu-sando. If I want sets (Teishoku), I rather go to Ippudo.

-Other items I want to try -
There were other nostalgic items like Omurice and Kissaten-style pasta with a ketchupy tomato sauce.

- Must dish -
We were both absolutely blown away by their pancake, outer texture of the cake is nutty-crunchy-sweet and fluffy soft and all combination was sick! It wasn't rich as Castella, a Japanese egg cake introduced by Portuguese in 16th Century. Excellent choice for sweet breakfast. Think of it, Castella could be a good choice as a pancake if toasted and give a crunchy outer skin.

- East meets West -
HC dishes are Japanese version of HK Cantonese style dishes or vise versa. HK style restaurants in C-town are Cha Chan Tang and, recently introduced by Michael L., Cafe Hong Kong. I found their dishes are ""East meets West"" like Hi-Collar.

- Sweets -
Another items that I want to try is their milkshake with cream(?).  Two big guys in a restaurant business-types were really enjoying it. I understood why those big boys were sharing only one, it was packed and high but I think it's a manageable portion for sweet lovers. Next item, they were having was the pancake.

- Entertainment -
Chatty and charming Yuko(?) talked fast, like mostly people from Osaka, with her uniquely Osaka dialect, Kansai-ben. She was comically very entertaining. Most famous comedians are from Osaka. It is worth coming by and see her show. She is the one closer to the entrance, and Chika is the one mostly in the kitchen, 

- Dream -
If I live near HC, this will be my go-to place as a neighborhood cafe, no sitting outside and watching people but feeling fresh in a clean and calm Japanesey space and listing to a ""swing"" feel Jazz and spend relaxing time for some minutes in the morning before going off to reality. If I am in a rush, get my coffee at the counter near the entrance.

- About - 
Hi-Collar is another hit spot of Mr. Shuji B. Yagi's (founder and president of the T.I.C. Group) creations, Soba-ya, Robataya, Cha-an, Hasak, Curry-ya and two restaurants next to HC (Rairaiken and Shabu-Tatsu) and more. Including Midtown restaurant, Sakagura and recently opened in May this year, Kiosku, Deli/ Bodega is a nice addition. Mr. Yagi owns 11 creations in the city and all of them are my favorites except, Otafuku. Their Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki are okay. Sweet things like Taiyaki and Daifuku mochi are fine.  http://www.tic-nyc.com/pages/restaurants.html",0
"Being a native Washington heights girl, I've seen the trial and tribulations of that little corner Heights Tavern is located. I was visiting the City the opening weekend of this establishment and decided to come with my mother because the atmosphere looks great and it's down the block from where I grew up. The place gets 2 stars mainly for the feel and decent waiters.

Where to start about how unimpressed I was? First, the menu needs some tweaking to get it into the ""tavern feel"". They need to really zone in the kind of cuisine they want to serve not all of the above like I saw: Tex-Mexican, Traditional-American, Southern Comfort Food, etc.  

I had a chicken sandwich and it lacked seasoning. The way the sandwich was organized, it wasn't layered properly. Usually when you bite into a good sandwich, each time you get a bite of the meat, lettuce, tomato and sauce. This was completely just off. 

My mother had the fried chicken with mash potatoes...this was an epic fail. The chicken came out RAW. The meat was clearly pink and needed a few more to cook. Raw chicken carries Salmonella which can get a person very sick for days. I informed the waiter about this and they took the plate away to do something. The next round that came out, was extremely over cooked and the batter was under seasoned. Someone needs to go into that kitchen and give the chef a bottle of Lawry salt and a thermometer to get that chicken right!  The Chinese take out place across the street from there makes better chicken and it's half the price for x2 the quantity. 

I was a little irked that they didn't even offer a complimentary drink for serving my mother RAW chicken but hey, there needs to be improvement to the staff in customer service.

Hopefully, they have some major improvements in the quality of food because this place will not be in business for long.",0
"King Noodle!!!! I have to send my compliments to the chef here. If you're sick of your old repertoire of cuisines, you've gotta go to King Noodle! Their menu is so unique, it's unlike any Asian style restaurant out there. I've been consistently impressed with every plate they have!! 

First, the kimchee carbonara was Perfect. A crazy unique combo of flavors, I've never had anything quite like this. The sauce was so tasty! 

The marinated beef skewers were the highlight of dinner, for me. The highlight of the last few dinners I've had! The steak is so tender, and the marinade- freaking delicious. I want more. 

Okay, the chili fries are also a MUST- I can't describe how good these are. We were scraping the plate at the end!! 

Not only their food, but the drinks were awesome too! The Grand mariner The scorpion bowl.. That's all I can say :) 

Bottom line: Funky asian fusion, done right.",0
"Ate here two days ago with a coworker - we both shared dumplings and got our own side dishes. I purchased the tom yum soup. Approximately 20-30 minutes after finishing our meal, I started feeling extreme stomach pains. I have been feeling the effects of food poisoning ever since and am still feeling the after effects now. 

I think it goes without saying that I will not return here, nor any of the other locations.

Update: I was sick for a total of 5 days. I am now fine. Still not going to go back.",1
"I won't waste my  time with this place. I won't discuss the decor and service ( both mediocre, although the staff is friendly).  Just going to say this:
I'm a European woman with a bionic stomach.  I can eat anything, nothing makes my stomach sick. Until I came to Tangled Vine. A place-- a wine bar, with a below average wine list.
Back to the bionic stomach. The burger I had at Tangled Wine gave me the runs in 20 min tops. Conquered!",1
I'm a loyal Benny Burritos supporter from back when I was in college. This place always offers great Mexican food that's consistent and amazing. Their margaritas pack a punch and they have a pretty sick happy hour deal that's worth checking out. They recently expanded the bar area and it makes a huge difference. One of my only complaints prior to the construction was that the bar was always felt too cramped and crowded. Now the space is open and airy. I highly recommend the shrimp quesadilla and their chicken fajita burritos are also a must try! They also have a great brunch menu.,0
"Luxor lounge, one of the most cost-effective hookah lounges in the Greenwich Village area. The service here was pretty decent, the decor is a bit shabby and not the best but I would definitely come back just to leisurely chill and smoke some hookah. 

THE GOOD: 4 shots for $10 and pretty inexpensive hookah. Be forewarned, well shots, are sometimes not your friend. However, they do cause excessive joy and behavior from time to time.

THE BAD: My co-worker got pretty sick and threw up multiple times (not because of the shots btw). Luckily, the staff was nice enough to not toss us out despite that. 

THE UGLY: Don't really know if it was the flavors I chose or maybe the hookah needed to be flushed out but no matter what I did, the hookah was very smoky and burnt. It kind of sucked but after a few rounds of shots, you probably wouldn't know the difference.

Overall, a fairly decent place with attentive staff. Can't really ask for much more than that.",1
Ordered the chicken curry tonight and got food poisoning a couple of hours later. Be forewarned of this place. I'll make sure to stay clear forever.,1
"I just had one of the most upsetting lunches of my life at Greensquare Tavern, a place where I've gone for several business and personal lunches and dinners and drinks with friends and coworkers. Here's what happened. 

Came with a new coworker to talk business and get to know each other at about 11:45. The place was mostly empty and we were promptly greeted and seated. 

She ordered an Arnold Palmer that ended up being a lemonade seltzer only the first time, then was a splash of iced tea over it the second time. The third time, the waiter poured a lemonade mix or something at the table along with iced tea, which looked much more Arnold Palmer-like but still wasn't quite right, maybe because of the organic/fair trade-type drinks they have or maybe because of a language barrier. But I digress.

My colleague ordered a cheeseburger and I ordered a turkey burger with cheese. Normally the fact that the waiter mixed these two up between two customers wouldn't be a big deal aside from embarrassment that we bit into each others burger and had to awkwardly request and either wait for or take out a redo. HOWEVER, I haven't eaten beef in 16 years and took a bite of her cheeseburger, which could make me sick since ones body isn't used to eating beef after a period of time like this and can have a weird reaction to it.

We asked to speak with a manager who came over to the table basically yelling at us, already on the defensive. He said he had already ""yelled at the moron in the kitchen"" (which for the record I would never want as it was a human mistake -- not a good thing but just an error nonetheless). He didn't let me get a word in and said a haste ""Sorry"" not caring that I was emotionally very upset about what just happened and that was it. 

We eventually got replacement meals and had to pay the $53 with tip for the beef and turkey burger and two nonalcoholic drinks -- he didn't even comp the meal! (Oh, right, he offered lunch on him when I said I was surprised he didn't comp the meal when I walked out shaking because I was so upset.) Unbelievable. I won't be back again and I will definitely tell my other colleagues about this experience.",0
"Went to Era recently for all you can eat. Enjoyed the hot items on the menu, however the fish didn't taste right, and was later quite sick. The worst part was that the waitress was quite rude - she informed me at the end of the meal that she added a surcharge for leaving sushi on the plate - something that had not been previously mentioned, nor did she seem to care about my explanation that I did not enjoy the food. Will not return, not worth the risk with so many reputable sushi places to choose from.",1
"The four stars are for their happy hour only - I can't speak about their actual dining room. I've been trying to come here for 8 years!! But hubby came here for a business function and got food poisoning awhile ago and refused to return. I finally made plans with a girlfriend to come on a Thursday after work where we sat at the bar and had the New England clam chowder, Manhattan clam chowder, raw oysters and razor back clams, and oyster sliders. They serve complimentary pretzels, peanuts, and oyster crackers at the bar (don't be fooled by the individual packaging. Help yourself!) The soups were good, the oysters better than average (and a great price at $1.25/each for a LARGE oyster), but my favorite was the oyster sliders! They were like 2 mini oyster po-boys with about 3 breaded and deep fried oysters in each slider. DELICIOUS. You MUST get this.

Fun, bustling environment. We were able to sit at the bar for about an hour and catch up over delicious food in an iconic restaurant. It also doesn't hurt that it's gotta be one of the most convenient places to meet up since it's in Grand Central! Great place to go, I'm going to recommend it to all my out-of-town visitors!",1
"Solid food and speedy service. However, the last times I ordered and ate fried rice, I felt kind of sick. It's hard to go wrong with General Tso's chicken at Nikko. The portions are pretty big. Never tried the hibachi but people look pretty entertained when they're having parties.",1
I search out cupcakes every city we go to and Molly's is my favorite! The cake is so moist and the frosting is not so sickeningly sweet like some other places.  Flavor combinations are creative and unique. Not much more I can add that hasn't already been said.,0
"Stella 34 Trattoria is a clean and modern styled restaurant on the sixth floor of--this is happening--Macy*s. (I know.) I was initially a bit afraid of the restaurant choice but let me say, IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!

Love the ambiance--it's extremely refreshing! Amidst the chaos of shoppers, piles and racks of clothing, and--did I mention--shoppers. No really, tourist shoppers who blindly veer into walkways while looking in every direction but the right one. It's like being in Times Square where they are all looking up and drifting as they walk and, if you're really lucky, stopping out of nowhere. THAT (that = hellish chaos).

And then, whew, air, breathing, it's not a mirage--Stella 34 Trattoria.

Already worlds happier than seconds before, the night's experience continued to climb up and up.

To start, we had a few vegetable small plates to share. Not only were they super delicious but they were presented beautifully.

The plating of the food stayed much in the theme of the restaurant, there was a lot of white with vibrant pops of color. The white dishes emphasize the rich color combinations within the dishes, each one looking exciting and enticing--you just have to dive in!

Once you do dive in, it's incredibly flavorful. Clean and flavorful. By clean, I mean every ingredient stands out in the right way--with purpose. It's impressive.

The dining experience at Stella 34 Trattoria quickly turns from pure enjoyment to curiosity over every item on the menu. Each item that we ordered was so good it made me want to try all of those dishes that I ruled out in the decision making process. (I suppose that's what brings people back to a restaurant. But in the moment I felt like a four-year-old having a tantrum because I want to eat more than I know I am capable of and would result in getting sick. I literally almost ordered a pizza after finishing my meal because my grandmother's looked so delicious.)

Beyond my obsession with the food plating, style, flavors, and overall deliciousness, is the service. THE SERVICE IS REMARKABLE. From the moment I entered the restaurant and was greeted, I knew I was in for a proper evening.

You see, I was offered a table before the rest of my party arrived. I was also given the option of enjoying a drink at the bar, or relaxing in the large lounge. When two more members of my party arrived, they were directed to the lounge--""there is a pretty girl waiting for you in the lounge""--I believe that she made a note of my location in her system. (fabulous service and compliment--too sweet!)

Wonderfully, that type of service extended to our waitress Sam. She was truly fabulous and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. She was able to have fun with us in a completely professional manner which only added to the exceptional experience that we had at Stella 34 Trattoria.

And then there's dessert (yes, I'm back on the food. And while I'm there, my ""Tortino Di Melanzane"" was excellent. I want it again right now as I drool over the photo I took of it). THE DESSERT IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DINNER! It's composed and thoughtful--just look at those textures, yum.

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BEING TOO PREPARED--AND STELLA 34 TRATTORIA OBVIOUSLY KNOWS IT! Shopped too long and don't have time to cook for the family? Just don't feel like sitting down to a meal? Like a moth to a flame got pulled towards the lit display case filled with deliciousness?

Yes, they have it all! Not only do they have a prepared food section--I know, ""not only""--but they have a gelato counter, too. Amazing. Take it all with you--no fuss, no muss. What a perfectly thought out experience! I can't wait to go back. CHEERS!",0
"This may be the worst Chinese food in Park Slope, especially for the money. There were globs of thick, sickeningly sweet, undissolved brown marinade (of the variety found in the Asian part of the international aisle at Key Food) at the bottom of my dish.",0
"Ok,  at this point, I have tried coconut cronut twice, and figs mascarpone once.  I have tried DKA, madeline the s'more thingy with some coffee.  I have seen Dominique Ansel himself the last two times I was there.  There weren't that many people that recognized him, but I didn't want to bother him cause I was pretty sure he was already sick of all the attention he'd been getting.

Anyway, personally I liked cocout cronut much more than figs mascarpone.  Still the texture of cronut is one of a kind.  Then I grew my love for DKA.  I have visited this store after cronut hours (about noon) twice, and both times I ended up getting DKA.  I still haven't changed my mind that the cronut is definitely worth lining up for 3 hrs once in a while.",0
"This Starbucks location is beyond disgusting. I had to make the horrible choice of using their bathroom and I would have vomited if I didn't think I would get an STD from getting too close to the toilet. I won't go in to details. 

After that initial experience, going to the counter and seeing the scraps of trash and sticky counters made it even worse. 

Luckily, a manager was at the register and when I expressed my displeasure with the state of their bathroom, he looked at me, said nothing, and then shouted to an employee (who was socializing with a friend) to clean it. Her response was ""I'm not cleaning no fucking bathroom"". Lovely.

I try to avoid Starbucks in general, but I really needed a coffee. I will never return here, even though my absence will cause no great hardship for the company. If I persuade even one person from going here, I consider it a job well done.",0
"This place is just terrible. I would've given it zero stars but I must admit that their portions are huge for the price. I ordered a burger, medium-rare, and got food poisoning the next day.
If you want to save your stomach from the tremendous amount of pain that it will suffer, I highly recommend not to come here.",1
"This place is right next to my office, so when we first moved in I decided to try it. I ordered through seamlessweb and got a spicy crunchy yellowtail roll and a shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer. The tempura appetizer was good...typical. The sushi was not. It was very warm (probably because they put it UNDER the tempura appetizer in the bag) and they stuffed way too much fish in the roll it was spilling out both sides. It didn't taste all that fresh and left me with that weird ""something's funky"" taste and feeling, so i ended up dumping the rest. I didn't get sick or anything but there are definitely better options than this place for sushi...perhaps i'll try the bento box lunch special though...",0
"My personal experience:

Although many of my friends are having a good experience with Go Organic NYC, I on my end am quite disappointed. 

1. The first food delivery was amazing. The fruits and veggies were really fresh and big! But all the following deliveries were far from being as good. Some veggies were almost rotten. (Could it be a sales strategy - to ""seduce"" the client on the first delivery?)

2. I got food poisoning from either their lettuce or their cucumbers.

3. I asked them to come pick up the food delivery box, and they did not come. In fact, I have asked six times (each time speaking to Brian) and they still did not pass by.

So it's either I'm unlucky, or they may have lowered their standards.",1
"My husband and I have a two-year-old son, so we don't get to go out a lot.  My mother-in-law came to town from Miami for Labor Day weekend, and made sure we got to go out every night - to take advantage of the babysitting.  We decided to spend our last night out at Woodland on Labor Day Monday night.  We live nearby, and the space is so beautiful, we often wish we could have an evening there.  We were so sad when the dinner was just terrible.  The staff were nice enough, though they were often nicely telling us that they were out of the dishes we requested.

When our third choice food came, we were just disgusted.  The grilled romaine salad was raw romaine lettuce with a bit of char.  The overwhelmingly fishy flavor of the salad I can excuse, since the waitress told me it was extremely fishy when I ordered it, but wow - it was way too fishy.  The ""roasted broccoli"" was boiled to limpness, covered in garlic, floating in water - not roasted at all.  The batter on the onion rings fell right off, so it was more of a mix of fried batter and limp onions.  My husband's burger was so under-seasoned he had to salt it at least three times.  Our drinks were watered down and careless. Though nice, the staff were hard to flag down, often chatting with each other in the far back corner.

I am usually the person who calls to compliment a staff person to their supervisor.  Not this time - we spent over $100 (and a precious date night!) on a meal that made me feel sick and upset.  

I e-mailed this review to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago to give them a chance to reply, but they did not, so I am posting it here.",1
"Since my office is in the area, so I often walk passed here, and finally last Thursday my friend was in the mood for Chinese, so I thought this will be perfect, we can try this place out. 

We went there around 6:30pm, the place not that busy, they have few tables people seated on it

We order the General Tso Chicken, Green Pepper Steak and a Steam Fish. 

General Tso Chicken was really bad, can't even taste the chicken, lots of flour on it, Green Pepper Steak was okay, and the Steam Fish is okay too

But the problem is, after we finished, I kinda got sick in my stomach. 

I wasn't feeling well at all, I had to go home and laid down 

Not sure what's going on, but I was afraid of Chinese for awhile. lol 

Sorry, not going back",1
"I've been here too many times to list. i love this place, no complaints. Service is excellent, I've had the grilled lemon pound cake every time and love it. The pound cake is not sicky sweet and not necessary with the figs that accompany it. The pork chop i had twice and first time was good, juicy but lacking a bit of flavor. I had it last night and it was kind of dry so maybe hit or miss with the pork chop but everything else I've had is great. I love that this place is in BK so that i can stop by for good food whenever i want. i've brought so many friends here & they've turned into repeat customers lol",0
"Oh my, what can I say about Midtown Buffet that hasn't been said already. 

I used to work 6 blocks north of this dump, and when my friends and I wanted a cheap Chinese food fix we would head there. By the grace of God my friend and I (who were the regulars of our office) never got sick. I can't say the same for the people that would tag along with us. 

In a perfect world, 9 bucks (including tax and tip) for a buffet in New York City should be a dream come true. You don't have to read my review to know that this place is a dream of Freddie Kruger proportions. 

The food is sub par (to be kind) and the waitstaff will hover (AND I MEAN HOVER) around your table until the bill is paid.

One day my friend and I walked there at lunchtime and the place was closed. We thought the place was another victim of the times. It turns out the place was temporarily closed by the NY Board of Health. God only knows what their grade was! I will not go into the gory details here but if you are curious go to the NY Board of Health website and plug in Midtown Buffet and STAND BACK!",1
"Came here for brunch. Had my 2 sangrias and the Latin Benedict. About 3 hrs later, had projectile vomiting and some...ahem, other GI issues. Never coming back here again.",1
"ordered a lot of wings for myself to make myself feel better and as motivation to clean my apartment
i was marathon watching something and really wanted them immediately
i live three blocks away and ordered about $30 of wings plus extra celery and carrots
i ordered at 5:59pm and called after 45 min and they said it would be another 15min and offered no consolation
i kept on trying to stop myself from canceling my order
but i was ""in a mood"" and didnt want to figure something else out
or leave my apartment
i called again, 20 minutes later and she said the delivery man had just left and said, exasperated,
""i mean this is an hour and forty-five minutes,"" they offered me 25% off my next order
when the order came the delivery man was very unfriendly and handed me a bag
it didn't have any other bags
i must have been the last order
the wings were pretty lukewarm, almost cold, with little sauce and not spicy at all. the ranch tasted
more like mayonnaise and immediately felt and got sick
a few days later i ordered wings from shorty's and it was great",1
"This place is terrible.

My first clue that it wasn't going to be good should have been the fact that there was no wait on a lovely Saturday afternoon when almost every other place in the area had lines out the door. My second was that we waited a while before we even got menus.  

I had the mac and cheese and my husband ordered the sliders. The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it was from a box. In fact, if it had been Kraft that would have been an improvement. The sliders were barely cooked and when cut open the middle was raw. The waitress didn't seem all that concerned with the potential food poisoning issue and after taking the plate away she disappeared for quite a while. 

They took the sliders off the bill but even then two iced teas and the mac and cheese still cost almost $20. There are plenty of places in the area to eat so I'd recommend choosing one of them instead of going here if you're in the area.",0
"There doesn't seem to be too many amazing bakeries on this side of town and I was tasked with getting a cake from here for one of our employees who was leaving.  This is definitely a small bakeshop, a small seating area inside and a limited number of items available for sale,  We picked a simple chocolate cake and it was pretty good.  Nice and moist, made with quality chocolate and the best part was the fact that it wasn't sickly sweet.  I obviously have loyalties to my bakeries but Clementine Bakery would do in a pinch if I needed something quickly in the vicinity of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.",0
"HEALTH DEPARTMENT RATING ""C""

STAY AWAY!!! FOOD POISONING!!!


First they have a C rating which they try to hide.
Secondly the rating is for meat and chicken that is spoiled and they vermin.

Third
We went to eat the other night and we had chicken and broccoli and fried rice.
The chicken tastes weird but didn't think of it being anything.  I had the worst case of food poisoning .. Beyond sick

I called the next morning to give them heads up and the lady's response was "" what do you expect me to do "" and there is nothing they would do cause we ate last night.

They seemed to not care , so I stopped in and the manager was very passive. He barely was concerned with the fact that I was to point  of going to the hospital with food poisoning.
He was more concerned with me not speaking to loud So other can hear.
Been here for couple
Of years but I have to say



STAY AWAY!!! STAY AWAY!!!!",1
"I never write reviews. Good or bad, I just leave it alone. But this was such a rip off and so nasty that I had to warn others. Do not oder here. Sure the delivery was fast! but who cares the food was disgusting! The pad thai was pink and tasted like SHIT! I order Chicken and broccoli and it was sour! This place needs to be shut down, after I called to let them know that the chicken tasted like it was old and spoiled, the young girl on the phone said oh sorry... They even messed up the drinks.  What a waste of $20 bucks..Go somewhere else, hopefully this place shuts down before somebody gets really sick from their spoiled food.",0
"$3 rolls, $3 beers, $3 appetizers happy hour got me in the door. I had the Kani salad, spicy salmon roll, shrimp tempura roll, and California roll. I would be happy just not get food poisoning for $3 sushi rolls but they were actually very good. They were lacking the flare, aesthetics, and the fresh wasabi you would get at other places. This is excused for their cheap prices.",1
"I really enjoyed my experience at Jacob's Pickles.  It is a cool atmosphere with tasty food to back it up.  

We were told the wait would be 20 minutes and that's exactly what it was, which is helpful.  The fact that they text you when your table is ready is also great.  

We started with the biscuits and fixins.  The biscuits are huge, buttery, fluffy, and flavorful.  The maple butter on the side was also delicious.  These are some of the best biscuits I've had.  

The entrees were also quite good.  I really enjoyed the catfish tacos--the fish was well cooked and the slaw and sauce were great.  The bacon,egg, and cheese biscuit was also awesome.  Everything went together really well and the chicken had a nice kick to it.  

Not to be forgotten, the drinks were also noteworthy.  I particularly liked the apple moonshine.

The one big miss of the meal was dessert.  If you've read any of my reviews, you know that I'm OBSESSED with bread pudding.  Naturally, I had to order the biscuit bread pudding.  First, it's HUGE (which is almost always a plus in my book); however, this thing was GIGANTIC.  I took a few bites and was disgusted.  It basically tasted like undercooked biscuits with a bunch of cruddy tasting ice cream on top.  This dish was not sweet at all.  It takes a lot for me not to devour dessert and I actually felt sick after 2-3 bites.  I think this dish would be much improved if they added something to sweeten it up like caramel or chocolate.

Overall, Jacob's is one of the better restaurants I've been to lately and I am definitely eager to return soon.",0
"Ko sushi, I hope you know that you just lost a loyal customer in the neighborhood and a new customer. Actually, we told you that and you didn't care anyway. 

This is my second time eating here. The first time was great. Solid, fresh sashimi with great service. It's what I expected on my second visit and why we came back. I left here not only disappointed, but literally sick to my stomach, angry and pissed off.

The sushi tasted TERRIBLE. The salmon sashimi was not fresh and showed up to our table appearing dried out with the edges a bit browned. I ordered a dragon roll and the avocado was also brown. The rice tasted off and oddly soapy. It had a smell that made me start to worry about Bacillus cereus. And why was the rice warm on the rolls?? This sushi was so mind-numbingly terrible, I began to wonder if I had forgotten what good sushi tastes like. Had I wandered so far from good quality sushi that I was doomed to sushi hell? All of the food except for our miso soups looked and tasted completely questionable. As the nausea and abdominal pain set in, I started to wonder if this night would be ending in multiple violent visits to the porcelain throne. 

We complained to our waitress when we finally were able to get her attention. She left to tell the manager and didn't return for 20 minutes despite trying to wave her over and telling the other waitresses and bus boys that we wanted our check. Eventually, she came over and stated, ""Sorry I told my manager and he said the sushi is fine. There's nothing wrong with our sushi."" After some discussion, she finally stated, ""We aren't going to give you free sushi, the manager doesn't care about your complaint. But if you want I will give you free ice cream."" 

We were by no means trying to get free rancid sushi. We had already handed her a credit card to pay. Frustrated, we went up to the counter when another 15 minutes went by as we were waiting for the card to return. Again we complained and the waitress went over to the manager, they laughed and joked. He never came over to the table and simply could not be bothered to speak to customers.  Eventually, the waitress returned with the bill and he took $5 off. FIVE DOLLARS! It was a complete insult. At least we knew the waitress was being honest... THE MANAGEMENT DOESN'T CARE. A 5-dollar discount was a slap in the face. There was no apology or any honest attempt to try to keep a loyal customer. 

There's a sushi joint on every block in this city. And this one isn't worth a dime of your money for its horrendous customer service. Frankly, I am more pissed about how insulting their management was than how repulsive and rank the sushi tasted. Don't come here unless you want crappy, likely unsafe sushi and management who could care less about their customers. Oh and by the way, that $5-discount paid for the Pepto Bismol that we had to buy after we left.",1
"Sick bar, sick atmosphere, cool owner, bartender Clarissa is great and super fun! I love this place!",0
"One word: pozole. OH MY GOD. It was the best pozole I've had in New York since I moved here. I was super sick with a cold and my mom used to hook it up with a caldo de pollo or pozole back in LA and let me tell you. BOTH ARE THE BOMB. Solid portion, too w/ all the fixins. I haven't tried anything else but OMG that pozole has me drooling right now!!!",0
"Like a true degenerate, I found myself hung over/still drunk/starving at the same time. At 9:30am. On a Friday morning. 
Naturally, my partners in crime and I all call in ""cough* sick to work, and start brainstorming food options. And...how we settled on ""meet at Hill Country BBQ at 11:30"" is besides me.

Well since noone cares about my sob story, here's the gist of it. They don't open til 12, so DON'T show up at 11:30 and ask to be seated. Yeah...

As much as Hill Country is over-hyped, not the best in the city, blah blah blah...the whole experience is just fantastic. It's not meant to be a fancy sit-down ""gourmet"" barbecue experience. It's served the way it's supposed to...like they do in the South. Get the mac n cheese, have some brisket if that tickles your fancy, but DEFINITELY get yourself a heapin' pile of ribs. Wash it all down with a cold Shiner, and we're in business.

I will DEFINITELY be back on a Monday for $27 all you can eat BBQ!!",0
"I used to come here every day. The best cheese danish ever!  But after 2 years of having cheese danish for breakfast I got bored. Lately it seemed like the cheese is different ( not in a good way). But when I think about it,  maybe I ate it so much that I got sick of the taste.
American cheese cake with strawberries on the top... Perfection!  The best ever.  And the cannolis are pretty good. ( the plain ones only,  the chocolate ones are too much). 
Service is ok. They got a lot of new girls lately,  I liked the some other girls that left a lot more. 
They open at 6 am.  And they are always open on holidays. Even though the line is super long.  But it's worth it. 
Oh yes almost forgot, please teach your new girls how to make a good macchiato!",0
"Promoter said it was a 'sick party' but it definitely did not live up to that or these reviews. Music was WAY too loud, space was narrow and over crowded with drunk smelly people.  Definitely not a classy ambiance (as listed above) whatsoever.",0
"Went here the last night of our Anniversary trip to NYC, Sept. 25, 2013.  
My husband ordered a burger which he thought was pretty good. 
 I wanted the Bucatini (pasta dish) but waitress said they were out of clams.  
I decided to order the raw Seafood Combo instead.  Since clams were supposed to come on that plate, waitress asked what I'd like in place of the clams - I said shrimp - but they gave me extra oysters....not sure why she bothered asking.  
But still I was excited that a crab claw came with it.  The shrimp were big, tasted ok, nothing special.  The oysters were small with no flavor but at least the cocktail sauce was good.
I excitedly gobbled down my first bite of the crab claw....immediately smelled something awful and had an awful taste in my mouth, but unfortunately it was too late - I'd already swallowed it.  At first I thought it was just me...but I smelled the crab claw again and knew it was rotten.  I told the waitress who picked up my plate and took it to a man behind the bar without saying anything to me (I didn't know if she was mad - or what - but since that's how she'd been all night, I didn't think too much about it.)
She didn't come back and say anything, but eventually the man behind the bar came over, said yes, it was indeed rotten and asked if I'd like him to go downstairs and get another crab claw from another box - I said ""thanks, but no thanks.""  He asked if I'd like something else to replace it and I opted for shrimp.  He brought me 3 shrimp and said he was sorry, but that's just how it is sometimes with seafood, you never know what you'll receive.  Maybe they should smell their seafood before serving it then!
Guess I should be grateful he gave me 3 shrimp, but if I had known I would be sick for 3 days after that, I would have asked them to take my meal off our bill!  My husband said the only thing that kept me out of the hospital was the fact that I was drinking alcoholic drinks with my dinner.
Guess I shouldn't have ordered seafood from a place named LT BURGERS, but since the Raw menu was more extensive than the 3 burgers shown on the menu, I assumed seafood was more their thing.  We ate seafood at several places in NYC and here in NC, we eat a lot of seafood and crab claws - this is the first time I have ever gotten rotten food anywhere....lesson learned about LT Burger.",1
"My absolute favorite drag queen gay bar. I go once a week with my friends. Always have a fabulous experience  usually walk in before 10, because that's when the first drag show starts. And these are some real drag queens, not the ones you see idolized on tv. Real woMEN with real bodies and real costumes, which is what I love. They're all unique and always put on a great performance. The bartender (pink is our favorite) makes decent drinks. Last time I was there (and reason for 4 stars over 5) is I ordered a pineapple rum, and in return I got literally that. A full glass of pineapple juice and a full glass of rum, separately. I'm sorry, what am I supposed to do with that? My friend then ordered a pineapple and vodka. She got 5 fingers of pineapple jar and ice. So when ordering make sure to be EXTREMELY specific. 
Overall though, a great place to stop if your sick of the usual bar scene.",0
"I went to this place with my sister for lunch. I had shrimps and she had ham with pineapple. First of all, the food was so bad (and so expensive btw) that we couldn't even finish it. And then we BOTH had food poisoning. Never going there again.",1
"Ordered garlic knots, meatball pizza, and a couple cannoli's last night. Got really sick from some, or all, of it. Not entirely sure what the culprit was. Had a pretty miserable night watching all of this food come back up my digestive tract, though. Something wasn't cooked properly and ya'll should be aware of it so no one else suffers the dreads of food poisoning.",1
"Horrible sushi. I was there on Sunday for dinner. I figure I haven't ate here for awhile, so why not. TERRIBLE MISTAKE. The rice wasn't even Japanese rice.. It was barely cooked.  The sushi was not fresh, they were rather questionable. I had food poisoning for 2 days now. I used to go there all the time. The quality of their sushi changed a lot. BUT the COOKED food was decent. I will never go back to this place if i want to eat sushi.",1
If I could give this place zero stars I would. Brought a mix of Chinese and sushi home. The food was so salty we had to throw everything out. I ate the sushi and some dumplings and spent the next 3 days sick in bed with a massive migraine. I'm very careful where I eat because I don't really believe chinese take out doesn't use MSG. We've taken food out from Peters many times before and never had a problem.,1
"Stopped in for a quick burger after reading some of the Yelp reviews. My wife and I shared the Santa Fe burger (avocado, cheese and onions) given how big they are. We also shared a greek salad and onion rings. The salad was a nice mix of ingredients with a light dressing. But that's about all that was good. The burger was dry and tasteless. I ordered it medium. The onion rings also had very little taste. Not sure what it was but something made my wife sick.

Lots of character in this little hole in the wall but I won't be back.",1
"i feel sick.... oh so sick....

shrimp & broccoli.... shrimp did not taste good and the broccoli was not fresh.

thankfully there was a bit of rice to eat since i got a combo.",1
"Okay so.
I've been hearing a LOTTA hype about David Chang and his Momofuku this and that and omg cereal milk.
This place did not live up to that hype, I'm afraid, but it was still good. But maybe this hype is dying down, there was no one in the shop when we stopped by Thursday evening.

Cereal milk soft serve is definitely a really cool idea, but I personally didn't love it. It's corn flake cereal milk, which is basically the most boring cereal to flavor milk with, and I found myself feeling a bit sick of it after just a few tastes of my friend's ice cream. I do like that they include crunchies at the bottom of the cup and coat part of your ice cream with some crunchies as well.
I was confused by the ""cereal milk kits"" they were selling. Isn't the key to cereal milk just... cereal and milk? What do I know about it, it's more likely that it was some kind of cool powder, I am guessing.

I got the SUPER hyped up crack pie slice.
I would describe it as basically a baklava-y custard-consistency pie. Like... it was good. I like baklava. I like custard-filling-type pies (holla pumpkin pie!). I liked the crack pie.
It was VERY VERY sweet, though. I couldn't even finish my entire slice. I think if I had a lighter dinner I would've been able to finish it more easily.
But I didn't understand the hype. It was good, but it wasn't ahmaaaaahzing.

And yes, there's no seating. That's okay but I guess I expected a little more. 

But I do have to say the staff was SUPER nice and fun. I liked them a lot.",0
"i cannot yell enough good things about Dino BBQ. everything we've ever had has been excellent. they have a great beer selection, very good cocktails and their servers are extremely friendly and professional. my husband had ordered the sausage, which was still in the smoker, and not only did the waiter come by multiple times to apologize for the wait, but then the manager came out and apologized and comped us a round of the beer that we were drinking. we had so much food on our plates, that the sausage was totally not a big deal, and the fact that they were so concerned about it even though they knew we were working on our other food was super conscientious, i thought! 
also, the portions are refreshingly reasonable, so you'll eat and you'll love it, but you won't feel sick and regretfully overfed afterwards.  
definitely need a reservation. this place is SLAMMED every time i'm there.",0
"This place is in a very cool setting in the Jane Hotel. I definitely want to go to more places like this when I'm older and richer. 

Anyways, I was having dinner here with a friend (because they don't do brunch reservations) and got the Smoked Trout Salad. Man oh man was that a good salad! My friend got some kind of egg merguez sandwich that was also tasty. For dessert we decided to push our stomachs and get the Chocolate Bread Pudding With Whipped Cream. Although it was very good (especially the whipped cream), we were very full and felt a little sick afterwards. 

All in all, I hope to return one day when I am hungrier and a bit richer.",0
"This place was a big let-down.  I studied abroad in Puebla, Mexico, and one of the things I miss most, and nearly impossible to find at Mexican restaurants here in Horchata, a traditional Mexican drink.  I saw that they had it, and so I made the mistake of eating at this place.  I asked the guy behind the counter if the Horchata was made fresh (i.e. from scratch) and he said it was, in the kitchen.  But after tasting it, I strongly believe it was made from a mix, and not a good one at that.  Very disappointing.  But I could almost let that one go because of a possible miss-communication or language barrier.
The food wasn't terrible, and I was starving, so it did the trick, but definitely didn't feel like the best quality.  It looked like slop, and tasted like what you'd expect in a Mexican middle school cafeteria. I wasn't impressed, and though it didn't make me sick or anything, I think there are other better cheap-eats in that area (though Wogies isn't one of them).",0
"So.. 2 slices of pizza and an order of fried calamari =17$
It wasn't 17$ when I ordered this the other day. Careful, they like to smooch off your money.
mind you their pizza is the worst, tastes cheap and it has gotten people sick in the past. Calamari is good but not $10+ good. Way overpriced for a dingy corner pizza joint. I wish this neighborhood had a 2bros dollar pizza. I could've bought 17 of them and they have a higher quality pizza or I could've went to a fancy restaurant and gotten me a proper 17$ dish.",0
"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with our meal here. The prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. We ordered the chicken parm plate which came with a choice of soup and a large portion of steamed veggies! I agree with some of the other reviewers - the chicken soup is delicious, exactly what I think of when I think chicken soup. My husband joked that we should get the soup here for each other when the other gets sick. The steamed veggies were simple, seasoned with salt, pepper and olive oil, but steamed perfectly and tasted delicious. My husband got the frutti de mari with linguine. The sauce was delicious, but the mussels and clams were mostly hollow and the calamari was chewy, but the shrimp were plentiful and delicious. With all that food + tax & tip, the total was only $37 - a value for the location and amount and quality of food! I think the current name of the place is Biu Bella and there is another entry for it on Yelp. It's a little confusing because the name of the place has changed a few times, but has always been some variation of similar words.",0
"I was expecting a lot from this place as I had a great experience at Yakitori Totto.  

We were seated in the back next to the bathroom and near a large party.  Why they even have a table there, I don't even know (you constantly having people walking past you to relieve themselves).  I can let that go.  What I can't let go is, the horrible service.  It was impossible to get any server's attention and when we finally are able to, we get served after other groups that asked for assistance way after we did.  This is simple things, like a water refill.  The food quality was horrid too for the price.  We ordered various yakitori, mussels, a carpacchio, and several tempura items (veggies, calamari, baby octopus).  The tempura was actually very soggy!  The meat was inconsistent and had a very strange taste, I suspect it was undercooked.

We both ended up sick that evening.  

The worse part of the night was since we were so appalled by the food and service we decided to give the bare minimum tip.  The waitress actually chased us outside and asked why we didn't tip more!  We explained to her the situation and she kept arguing ""But I served you guys right?""  

I rarely say this and I'm generally forgiving and open minded but AVOID THIS PLACE unless you have a party of 5 or more.  Personally, i'd still avoid this place and head straight to the much better sister restaurant Yakitori Totto.",1
"I ordered some soup because I was at home sick with the flu. I got a call that the delivery guy was here. So I buzzed him in... And waited... And waited. I finally called him back, at which point he told me that I needed to walk downstairs and pick it up. I said that I was sick, and asked if he would please walk it upstairs. I live on the fourth floor (but less than a block from ZV). He went up one flight and refused to walk up any more. And this is the problem with tipping in advance. The soup was fine.",0
"Mediocre food, delivery took over an hour and a half, and my roommate ended up with food poisoning from her chicken parmesean. Gonna go ahead and stay away from this place in the future",1
"Eater Beware, you might get food poisoning.  Location deemed unsanitary and plain just nasty.

Location is very busy, mix of officers workers and tourists.  Lines can be long during peak times.  Location is pretty small and tight.

Expect to wait at least twenty minutes until you get a chance to order.

Condiments bar was disorganized and unclean.

Staff is very nice and professional, but food tasted very bland for some reason.  Been to many other locations and others have tasted fresher.  

When I eating, the men's bathroom flooded.  $H!TTY toilet water was gushing out and underneath the door.  The pool then spread across the floor and next to the soda machine.  I have witnessed numerous customers reporting the incident to the workers, but they didn't seem to give a CRAP (literally) about the situation and continued to take orders from customers.  

It probably took them a good 15 minutes before someone came out to check on the toilet pool.  When a worker did come out to clean it, all he did was take a squeegee and pushed the water UNDER THE SODA MACHINE.  There's a hole in the ground, but it's the same hole that is shared by the soda machine tubes.  The same tubes that bring up the soda and syrup for mixing and thus...that is what you drink. I'm not sure where the toilet water went when it went down into the hole, but I sure as hell hope that it didn't mix with the soda people drink.  

I did not notice a NYC Health Code, but I would grade this place an automatic F.",0
"Service was quick, efficient and came with a smile. Little that I know that they were smiling at the terrible food poisoning they were providing me with.

"NEVER AGAIN. I knew better than to go here but I was desperate. desperate I tell you.

Agadashi Tofu was made with firm tofu - horrible. 
Miso soup was dropped onto the table like the waiter was feeding his dog. 
Had a bento box with OK tempura and salad but the sashimi was tasteless tasteless tasteless! and the california rolls were made with obviously OLD imitation crab since it smelled bad and the rice was was crusty and salty. Just sad looking really and I couldn't touch it. I felt sick afterwards.

Rude staff. Stop going here please people. JUST STOP.",1
"What's really amazing is that this place has almost 100% bad reviews, and yet they are still in business. I order from Vine when I get desperate. I try to avoid disappointment by ordering the same simple thing over and over again, but even that isn't foolproof with these people. I usually get the same rude delivery guy (for five years now) who grunts like a Neanderthal because he hasn't bothered to learn one word of English, and who again, like a Neanderthal, snatches my tips and gives me a dirty look as if he's insulted before he scurries away into the forest. 

Not only do they have bad service and average to sub-standard Asian fusion food, but recently I noticed that the portions on some of their dishes have been downsized. Downsized portions of crappy food? Now that's balls beyond the size of Jupiter. 

Finally, after reading some reviews here that reported a dead cockroach in someone's soup, two reports of a queasy stomach and food poisoning, and a health department rating of ""C"", I've decided that there is no level of desperation that will make me order from this place again. There are plenty of restaurants in the Columbia area to choose from, so there's no need to play Russian Roulette. In fact, there's a really good authentic Asian place between 103 and 104 on the west side of the street. It's similar to Vine, but minus the roaches, the crappy food, neanderthal delivery guys, bad service, food poisoning, and overall disappointment.",1
"I was excited to see this place in the Chelsea Market. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my husband got the pork belly one. Mine was really salty with too much seasoning. My husband's sandwich was too greasy. He can handle 10 times more of bacon fat and greasy food in general, so when he wanted to switch his sandwich with me, it was REALLY greasy. Oil from pork belly was dripping so bad and ruined my brand new vest as well.... 

The worst part was the amount of MSG in the food. We both grew up eating food with no MSG (i know... it's not typical as Asians), and because of that we can identify the taste of MSG and am slightly allergic to this - i get a headache, feel sick, and feel dehydrated. It turned out to be one of our worst meal during our visit to New York. Their ginger beer was pretty good, though.",1
"Do not go here, go anywhere but here.  Gross gyro ""meat"", tzaziki sauce was expired hellmans mayonnaise.  Wasn't cheap either, next time we won't pay that much to get sick (from the quarter of the meal each of us ate, the rest went into garbage).",1
"Definitely not the best Indian food you'll ever have, but it was a decent experience since I was craving some quick, cheap Indian food. The service here is decent, and they allow you to smoke at tables outside of the establishment. The place is also notably lighted in all kinds of different Christmas lights, which my friends and I found pretty sick. Food was decent. I ordered the Lamb Masala and gulab jamun for dessert, while  my friends got the chicken curry with garlic naan and banana fritters respectively. Both the gulab jamun and banana fritters were very good. But my friend and I personally found our main courses a bit underwhelming in flavor. The portioning was also a little questionable, though we did end up full from the bread that they offered us beforehand and the mango icecream they offered afterwards. Overall, you'll definitely find better deals for Indian food around NYC, hell, even on 6th street. This place isn't horrible, but yeah, you can do better.",0
"Just returned from lunch hour at Dos Caminos. I feel sick! The food was horrible, wannabe Mexican food with the same flavors throughout all the plates. The guacamole is just that, guacamole. Nothing special. I would never/COULD never go back. Even more terrifying -  trying to wash away the taste with Starbucks.",1
"Two words: Food poisoning. Went to this place last week everyone said this place was ""SOO cool"" and that they made you wait 2 hours but is ""totally worth it."" Well after living in the neighborhood for 5 years I finally went. I remember my first thought when i walked in, ""hipster nonsense"". But alright I was there i was going to give it a try. So I sat down and ordered  a bunch of things. I ordered a drink from their extremely limited wine list. The food was decent the fried rice was good but its a chinese restaurant.. it should be. What followed was what garnered this place 1 star. I was sick throwing up for the next 24 hours and then the place was SHUT DOWN by the board of health 5 days later for 70 violations including RAT FECES in the food prep areas. I could not be more disgusted. I cannot tell you how upset I am that I tried this place. I hope this place stays closed and I will personally do everything in my power to make sure this is the case.",1
"Honestly, the quality of soup is just not that good. Tasted like the stuff my mom made me out of the can when I was sick. I was disappointed at the rude service and I can't say that I will come back any time soon.",0
"This place is a dump.  While they are renovating they are trying to conduct business as usual.  Later at night they have workman sheet rocking and plastering right over your food, with minimal protection to the food stuff.  Last night a man was plastering a wall directly over the bakery items with barely a sheet of plastic covering the food items.  In another aisle, the entire floor was being drilled at in an effort to lift off the old tiles.  Dust and other debris was all over the place.  But forget the renovation... This store is always a dirty place.  And while I've been shopping here for years, I'm staring to get real concerned abou the safety of the food in this place.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Marie Calendar's pie for 10.00 and found when I took it home it was a mess - it obviously sat on a hand truck waiting to be unpacked and put in the freezer for quite some time.  I'm concerned about all the pre sliced (in store sliced) meats and cheeses in one of the coolers where the stuff looks like its been sitting a bit to long.  Everything in this store is a dirty mess.  I'm sick of shopping in dirt and so have decided not to go there anymore",0
We had food catered for a work party. I've been to BKNY and Erowan in the area they both sick compared to this place. The pad se yu is amazeballs. The spicy peanut sauce is great. Chicken satay as well. Great place can't wait to get more food again.,0
"I hate to have to write this review, but Van Horn earned it last night.

We've been there a few times in the past and liked it- their fish sandwich is really great and I love the mac and cheese. The service can be spotty, and the place is on the pricier side for sandwiches, but overall it's been a solid choice. Buuuuut, my husband woke up at 3am this morning, about 6 hours after eating their pulled pork sandwich, with a nasty case of FOOD POISONING. It was the only thing he ate last night so there are no other suspects.

Doesn't get much worse than that.",0
"The Spinach Artichoke Pizza is beyond amazing. It's not even funny how much I with they sold it by my house. 

Savory, Salty, Cheesy, it's delicious, and huge so be careful. Everytime I eat a slice i'm STUFFED to the point I get sick but it's so good I can't stop eating it!",0
Had terrible food poisoning after having a chicken salad sandwich. AVOID!!! BE WARE!,1
"The food was bland and boring, overpriced, and too simple for a restaurant. And I got the WORST FOOD POISONING.",1
"Didnt find out about this place until the Cronut explosion. But my boss comes here every morning for coffee and breakfast. She was not happy when the Cronut thing happened, since it takes her forever to get coffee...no coffee for boss = mean lady. LOL~

Anywho...with the line starting at 5AM...its kinda sickening..i dont think i can wait that long for pastry...I still need to try the cronut some time in the future, at the meantime, i ate their DKA a couple times, since my boss buys them for us...hehehehe...and i also had their Souffle...they have different flavors every month for their pastries..its hard to keep up with the trend!!

Mr.Ansel is one smart man!",0
"I am literally typing out this review in the midst of my meal. If you live in Bed Stuy (of course depending upon where.), you'll know that if you're looking for a great place to deliver you some decent grub, you're most likely SOL. Unless you want mediocre Chinese food, Indian food or soul food. One of which I'm very sick of and two of which aren't my style. Anywho, upon finding this place on delivery.com, I was skeptical from some mixed reviews. Months later (today), I decided to use an $8 discount on delivery.com and try this place out while it seemed most convenient. After choosing from the various options on the menu, I went with these items:

Spicy girl roll (Shrimp, spicy crabmeat, avocado, tempura flakes and a cream cheese dip deep fried and topped with 2 chef's special sauces.): Pleasantly surprised. This tastes like so many different things all at once, but the ONE thing that it definitely does taste like, is greatness. It is a little spicy, but definitely nothing a lightweight can't handle. Unless you're a wuss.

Rock shrimp (crispy shrimp in house spicy mayonnaise): I expected this to be good. I thought it would be your typical breaded shrimp with spicy mayo sauce. Sounds good to me. After seeing it for the first time, I questioned that notion. Upon tasting it, I knew I was right. The mixture of the crispy orange coating (don't let that turn you off!), mayo and shrimpy taste couldn't be more awesome. 

I also got vanilla mochi ice cream but I haven't tried that yet. Will update the review once I've had that. But how can you mess up something so simple? We'll see. But for now, the verdict: definitely worth trying.

^^^ And that is why this review sat in my drafts for months by accident. The vanilla mochi was delicious, if you are hesitating whether to get it or not, hesitate no longer! Since this first order, I've also tried the Special Philadelphia Roll. Soooo super delicious. Highly recommended.",0
"Food Poisoning! I had the pleasure of vomiting mediocre food for the following 8 hours after dining at the Manhattan Cafe.  The staff was unfriendly and maintained the classic disposition of Manhattan diners where every employee will tell you ""It's not my job"" despite whether it is really there job or not.  One waiter will bring the coffee, (somewhere in the mix someone will poison you) another takes your order and then another brings your check.  
The food was sub-par even by Denny's standards, whereas the furniture and fixtures promised a Mad Men caliber dining experience.  
Continue down the street to anywhere else.",1
"I would've given this place a 4 star because the food was yummy. BUT, my husband got food poisoning from eating here last night!!! We had the Groupon so we ordered Belini with salmon caviar, Russian dumplings, short rib, and veal stew. Not sure what has caused the food poisoning, but if I had to take a wild guess, it'd be between the salmon caviar and the short rib (of which my husband ate significantly more than I did). Minus 2 stars. 

On top of that, maybe because we used Groupon to come here, service was really bad and slow. After our first two vodka shots, we wanted more. Somebody took away our empty glasses, but lacked the common sense to ask if we needed more. We asked for the drink menu, and that one person who seemed to be dedicated to take orders on his iPad was too busy adjusting lighting or music volume to stop by and ask do u guys want more. Oh well, if you don't want us to spend more money, that's fine. 

Oh and they included 18% tip in the bill. Maybe the people there knew their tips were included, hence there's absolutely no incentive to provide services? 

Another note, it felt really clubby at the restaurant. The light was dim, the music was clubby and loud, the people at the bar were drunk and obnoxious. Definitely NOT ""fine dining"" experience.",1
"The service was poor, the food was cold....and 2 hours later I was literally sick to my stomach.I actually  called the restaurant to complain and the manager was not helpful. Dont go here",1
"Stay away!!!! We had a table of 4 at a table sized for 2 people. One person at our table ordered pork, it came out raw! When we sent it back, they put the pork that the person chewed into back on the grill, saliva and all! They did bring out a new order of pork, and that was also raw.The manager said it was common practice! DISGUSTING!!!! We were also told that pork can be pink, NO, pink pork can kill you! Don't go here, you won't be happy, and may die of food poisoning!!!!",0
"i'm updating my review to add 2 stars instead of one only because one of the owners emailed me to apologize for my numerous disappointing  visits and food poisoning. I'm sad this neighborhood bar/restaurant isn't doing more to make sure that it builds a loyal customer base that doesn't only include friends of the staff (who get served first almost always, depending on the bartender.) And I agree with what people are saying about the smoking on the patio. why eat high end food (not cheapo bar food) and be surrounded by chainsmoking?",1
"So here is another one of those small places seating- and standing around-wise, one of those typical, lovely order and take-out food joints in the Village between Washington Square and Houston Street and between Houston and Spring Street, where maybe 8 people can sit while the rest stand and try not to block the next customer waiting to order, standing outside to eat at the open air entrance upon getting their pizza and drink if not going off elsewhere. The atmosphere is nice otherwise: low-key incandescent lighting and a big subway transit map framed on the wall. The various pies all look nice put up bare on the counter front behind glass by the register, where the man cuts out cleanly the individual slices before putting them in the oven.

Plain cheese is $1, while everything with a topping is $2--save meat or veggie protein ($3); drinks are $1.25; a cheese pie, meanwhile, is $10; the logic eludes me, too.

But price and space isn't my big qualm here. It's this: Percy's has a C rating from the NYC Health Department, the lowest acceptable one there is, and as of less than two months ago. That made me pretty concerned, especially when I read that there was evidence of rodent presence. 

I haven't gotten sick from Percy's, and I don't know anyone who has, and the double cooked pizza slices have well-melted cheese and delicious crust--softly bready but thin enough to be simultaneously brittle and crispy--and the guy made me 6 pies once from dough-stage in less than 15 minutes (and all 60-something people loved it, too), but it's hard to be comfortable eating food cooked by someone else in a place that's reportedly crawling with stuff. Despite the turn on of the good pizza, and despite my love for Pixar's Ratatouille, this rodent thing is a big turnoff..........",0
"you know what this place isn't so glamorous and theres tons of stupid kids and creepy horny desperate men who wouldn't get off me and my friends so believe me that's whats truly holding me back from giving five stars, its the actual people
the main floor seemed to have the best range of music, from hip hop to dance music to house to oldies, that's whats on that floor
the floor in the basement was weird, like before you walk in there youll see tattoo artists doing work, and body painting
and then in the room which is called the kinky room, it was way too small and crowded, with people dancing in their briefs and private parts hanging out, so yeah wasn't feeling that floor
the floor upstairs was so weird, but had sick lights couldn't lie, it was like dubstep mixed with hip hop and salsa, not my type of music but it had to be the most interesting yet weird room lol
the vip levels on the top above the weird floor don't look very nice for vip, ive seen clubs with sick vip floors, so not worth it at all!
expect fights in the bars,and the dancefloor, I was ready to fight too actually, so beware
security however was pretty good , they actually do have manners which I greatly appreciate ! they actually went up to the people and introduced themselves which Ive never seen before in the city",0
"Horrible Italian Food.

This place is a disgrace. The waiter who was quite rude. He was from Sicily. We spoke in Italian so I expected the food to be authentic. Unfortunately it was not. It was of such poor quality that I actually got sick from it. The chicken was tough and tasted like it had been left in the freezer for way too long. The eggplant had a disgusting taste and the wine was cheap and bad. Please do not eat here. It is not worth your business.

One good thing was the décor and the outdoor seating.",1
"The Ginger Man is a great place to come and do the following challenge: have 1 pint of every beer selection on tap. Alcohol poisoning guaranteed to follow. Or you can switch it up and have 1 of every bottled beer. You'll get the same result. Ambience is loud and crowded, so bring a megaphone and speaker so you and your friend can have a conversation.",0
"I go to this place occasionally when I crave Korean style donkatsu.  The food is a bit greasy and I usually get sick of it when I get to my second piece.  Service is just okay, not so good when they are busy.",0
New help? Used to be my favorite diner until I found maggots in the vegetarian borscht and my bf got sick from the what will forever be known as the Chernobyl beef. It was ugly. I'm just gonna try not to think about it.,1
"I am not sure if I would return. I appreciate the attention to detail though.

We went to celebrate a special occasion. I was stressed out the whole train ride there because we had changed our reservation to three people the day before and had to change it back to two because my grandmother got sick. I saw on the original change email that they have a $175 per person cancellation fee. So I sat there on the train at 10am, also the time 5000 other people were probably calling to get a table a month from today, for half an hour trying to get connected to a ""reservationist."" I finally hung up, called their confirmation line, left a message, and they called back.

They didn't charge me the $175 cancellation fee for changing the reservation back down to 2 people, which was nice of them, but the thought occurred to me, ""Even for a special occasion, why go to a restaurant that is so expensive and in demand and punitive that there would even be a risk of being charged $175 for nothing? Why sit on the phone and get stressed over this for basically an hour before handing over about half a month's rent for a lunch for 2?""

The food was fine. The sauces were outstanding. The portions were small. The first bites and the desserts were the highlights. The pork belly had too much gelatinous fat and I wouldn't have paid a $50 supplement again for the wagyu tartare. The consomme with the scallop was (obviously?) cold and tasteless. The waiters were countless and lovely. Even though the service is included, I rounded up $18 to the nearest $20 and still felt cheap.

There was a guy sitting behind us bragging loudly about the new buildings he was building in midtown and the view of the Statue of Liberty from his penthouse apartment, proclaiming that ""real estate keeps this city going"" and lamenting class warfare.",1
"I had a very bittersweet experience.

SWEET Experience  ---The appetizers are delicious, they are a variety of cold appetizers of vegetables and meat.  Definitely worth trying because the flavors are unique, strong, but not over powering.  

This place is well known for their Xiao Long Bao ( soup dumplings) and there noodles, and I can see why.  The flavoring is just right, the skin doesn't pop very easily when you try to pick it up. But the skin isn't thick either, still relatively thin and the meat is moist and flavorful.  The soup is actually slightly less fattening compared to many other Main St restaurants.  

I ordered the Kung Fu Beef Noodle Soup, and the flavor is great.  Definitely a fattening dish, but it is delicious. the Beef is flavorful and well marinated, the soup is great, although I preferred it to be lighter and less salty.  I am not sure what kind of noodle they use, but it is just right.  One of the most amazing noodles I had ever had.  Not too thick, or too thin.  Not to soft or too chewy.  It has a nice texture and it soaks up the flavor in the soup very well.

BITTER EXPERIENCE----- I also ordered a bowl of soy milk because I love  sweet soy milk with fried dough.  This is a very popular combination.  I felt fine with all I ate so far, and lastly I drank my soy milk.  In the end I started to feel nauseous, dizzy, and my stomach was upset.  About 20 minutes later, I had a terrible urge to throw up.  My mother and I both threw up.  She only had the soy milk, therefore we concluded the soy milk wasn't prepared properly.  Possible just for today!

Soy milk is made from soy bean which gets blended with water, then boiled.  Without properly processing the excess waste and boiling the liquid extract from the blending, the soy milk can make people sick.  Therefore, anyone who plans to make soy milk, make sure you boil it long enough.  This place certainly didn't, my mother and I had to suffer for the consequence. 

I recommended everything else, but the soy milk.  or maybe nothing from this place, I don't know what exactly made me throw up, but that is one possible conclusion.",1
"Haven't you people heard the News?......... People got sick, HEP A, I believe,  No thanks",0
"Living around the corner from the Long Island Bagel Cafe started off as a dream. It is near impossible to find egg bagels in Manhattan so I thought my prayers had finally been answered. 

Boy, was I wrong. 

After multiple deliveries, and multiple chances, I have officially started a personal boycott against this Long Island chain. 

Reason 1: The delivery men are horribly inappropriate, having attempted very forward, un-wanted and un-warranted sexual advances on both my sister and myself. After calling the Long Island Bagel Cafe to complain about this incident, and my incorrect order, THEY SENT THE SAME MAN YET AGAIN. I find this not only disrespectful and revolting but also a complete lack of sense. As a woman living alone in NYC, this is outrageous. 

Reason 2: I have to assume that the workers here have the literacy levels of a 1st grader- and that might even be saying a lot. I have never ordered from the Long Island Bagel Cafe and received what I ordered. Most of my orders have been online, how my order can still be incorrect when it is sitting there, printed out is beyond me. And never once, throughout all of my horrid experiences was I ever offered a discount on my terrible meal.

Reason 3: The food, apart from the bagels, is horrendous. I made the mistake of ordering a sandwich, not once, but three times to give the Long Island Bagel Cafe a chance. The croissants where sopping wet and soggy, falling apart as soon it was touched. The meat was old and everything inside the sandwich was wet. It certainly wasn't the honey mustard that I had ordered either. Close to vomiting, I threw away my latest meal, delivered to me at 1:45PM. 

In summary, I would say to stay as far away from the Long Island Bagel Cafe as possible.",1
"Food poisoning danger.  I used to get take out at this place pretty frequently until we got some sushi that had gone bad.  When I stopped in the next day to tell them about it in person, they denied that the fish was bad and told me everything was fresh.  I was very appalled since I was a regular, not some random one-time customer that liked to complain.  I also didn't ask for my money back, I just wanted to let them know about the issue so they wouldn't serve the food to other people.  I politely stated again that the fish they served yesterday had a very off odor and then they pretended not to know English anymore!  Their Chinese food had always been pretty generic, it was the cheap sushi that made this place worth going to.  But ever since this incident, we haven't been back.  And they have a minimum for credit card purchases even though it's clearly against the Visa and Mastercard rules.",1
"I really don't understand the hype at Carbone. I have been three times. The first time I went was during the first month they opened. I got deathly sick in the middle of the night from their dinner. I do believe it was either the clams or the pasta with the lobster. The second time I ate here I had to try the veal parm that everyone was raving about. I come from a very traditional italian family and i was soooo disappointed in Carbone's sauce. To me it tasted a bit sour. They needed to take the bitterness out of the tomato's.  The third time was this past Saturday evening. We had an 8:30 reso, sat at 9:45. Didn't offer a cocktail, dessert or anything in between. With the bill way over $1k for 4 people I was terribly annoyed. Oh and our  ""old school"" waiter that went missing for about 45 minutes in between. ...Michelin Star how? One word...Cahoots!!!",1
"Has been going downhill in terms of the food quality and portion size.  String beans are not supposed to be the color of baby's diarrhea and the texture of the mashed potatoes-they have to be bright green and crispy, not mushy.  Staff needs to learn how to count-if small plate is 3 meatballs and large is 5, don't give me 4 meatballs with the large plate, that's cheating.  The servings for the sides used to be heaping spoons, now, they barely cover the spoon.  Was great, now seems more like a rip-off.",0
Food freshness is a problem.  Got food poisoning one time after eating tuna salad there.,1
Really good and very sick service once you sit down. The only issue is that there is like a 2 hour wait.,0
I w'll never recommend this place to nobody...!! Firstable it is not authentic peruvian food and second it is not fresh and tasteless and third we get sick very badly.... PLEASE  guys..BEWARE WITH THE FOOD..!!!,1
"I was excited about this spot as others (omnivores) have said it's great. We ordered a few items to try. Things we tried:

Almond coconut chicken (fried but lack of flavor, where's the coconut?)

Roti canai (tasted too much like massaman curry not like the sauce I'm used to vege or not, check out Nyona on Grand St). 

Creole soul chicken (I never use this fraze: meh, no flavor at all. I was excited for this. I love creole Cajun chicken, no spice no flavor. The mashed taters that came with were meh too.)

All in all its basically battered and fried soy protein, something akin to a morning star nugget. I got a little sick from all the soy protein. 

Maybe other folks are just excited about fried food, which I don't mind but give it some distinct flavors. 

I prefer Quantum leap on Sullivan street foe vegetarian dishes. 

My dos centavos (drops mic)",1
"The absolute worst meal I've ever had. No exaggeration.

Ordered the regular chicken sandwich meal and a cookie. The fries were cold and undercooked (how does that even happen?); the chicken sandwich meat was stringy and cold with lettuce  - that looked like it'd been taken from the butt of the lettuce - piled high; and the cookies were burnt. 

The temperate and texture of the food is quite puzzling. I'm surprised I didn't get sick from this godawful food. Never again!",0
Unlike the previous review i don't agree with it.  Had dinner with a group of friends this past saturday and our server had a person mirroring him and they both didn't know what they were doing.  Three of us ordered there chicken which was recommended and when i cut into mine it was so under cooked. I mentioned this to one of your waiters and they take it away and replaced it with a over sauced chicken and never asked me if I wanted something else.  They tried to make good about the situation but I ended up getting sick from the uncooked food.,1
"Fact: you are dining at an airport.

Fact: you are also in the US Airways terminal.

Fact: you are dining at the US Airways terminal at the airport.

This place, the above considered, is not bad.  Had the kale salad which was pretty good, other food is slightly above average.  Pricing consistent with being held captive at airport.

I read of someone feeling sick after eating oysters here in a previous review.  See above factual statements, and decide on your own if this is a great place for raw oysters.  I'd likely avoid raw seafood at the airport, but hey, who am I?",0
"I've been wanting to come here for the longest time after seeing all the awesome tasty pictures of takiyaki and okonomiyaki. 
My friend and I finally visited this place on a Friday night and both ordered a combo b. 
There were quite a few people so we went to get pommes frites before coming back to order. 
The portions so big I was really full, however it was not what I expected. The sauce was awesomeeeeeeee it was amazing. The takoyaki balls were just...a soft chewy doughy thing with a piece of octopus in there, after two balls I was completely sick of it. The okonomiyaki just tasted like cabbage and flour. So after  eating both, all I felt was flour and dough in my mouth. I couldn't get myself to finish it. 

Don't think id be coming back.",0
"This place was packed solid when we went there on a Saturday night - you could tell a lot of Romanian families go there dressed up for a night out.  

The appetizers (salad and fried cheese) were ok, and they basically gave you a whole loaf of bread for the table.  The entrees looked amazing when they came out - my mother-in-law got a stewed chicken leg with polenta, my husband got a skinless sausage with fries, and I got the Romanian stew with polenta (one side had cheese topping and the other had a fried egg).

Unfortunately, just like several other previous reviews, my Romanian stew was cold.  Not just ""it got cold"" from sitting out - it was obviously from frozen/refrigerated and heated up by microwave.  The flavor was actually REALLY good, but after 3-4 steaming hot bites, the meat in the middle was literally ice cold.  I had them bring it back to reheat.  They obviously just put the whole plate in the microwave, as when it came back, the cheese was totally melted/rubberized on the polenta and the egg was practically hard boiled/rubberized as well.  I took another few bites and it was the same thing:  one bite was piping hot, and the next was lukewarm at best.  I gave up and just ate the polenta and egg - and the egg had an egg shell in it!!

At this point I just had to stop altogether.... I'm just glad I didn't get sick.  I really wish I could have given this place a better review, as everyone else had a great entree.  The service was ok and they were apologetic about the cold stew, but this is obviously an ongoing problem and food poisoning waiting to happen.  As an experienced microwaver, all I have to say is this:  stir the food around halfway through microwaving and it will be fine. 

Otherwise, it was decently priced for a good selection of food.  Also, they don't take AMEX.",0
"I was in the area Monday night and was in the mood for sushi. This place seemed to have very good reviews, so I figured why not?

Food-

The sushi was decent.  Each roll averages about $3. You get nicely sized and seemingly well-prepared rolls. I had the Eel Avocado but Spicy Tuna was better. Ok so why the 2 stars? Read on..

Jeez, this placed looked dirty! Someone mentioned it in a previous review and I should've listened. They try to keep the place tidy, but as a person who values cleanliness, I was not happy. The walls look stained, the corners of the floors looked sticky and clumpy as if they haven't been mopped in months. Take a look at the fire extinguisher on the floor by the kitchen, it's disgusting! The booths were dirty and the place smelled moldy! It was a weird stench but I recognized it as soon as I walked in, almost like an old abandoned mildew-filled home.  If a place doesn't put effort into making their establishment spotless, can you imagine how they handle your food behind closed doors? Especially Sushi which requires a lot more TLC. 

The ambiance was completely dead and they don't even have background music. This place needs severe renovation. The servers were forgettable and did not go out of their way to be friendly. Yes, the sushi itself was decent. Yes, I was hungry. Yes, I worried about food poisoning. Yes, I'm ashamed I ate there.. but what's a girl to do? Yes, I will NOT eat there again! 

I would've given it 1 star but bc the sushi itself was pretty good and I didn't die of food poisoning, I gave it 2. That's good right?",0
"Well PK, if you wanted me to stop coming here at all to eat, with my last visit you may have succeeded. 
Came here for brunch at the recommendation of a friend when we had plans to go elsewhere. There was no paper brunch menu apparently-the waitress didn't know what was going on-I just said I would like scrambled eggs. She didn't tell me the brunch plate came filled with meats, nor did she seem to know anything about the brunch menu at all. As I usually get burgers here, I should have stuck with a burger. The eggs/sausage/ham/bacon beef platter was uber greasy and made me almost sick to my stomach. I ate just the eggs and picked some at the bacon. I ordered this with a bloody mary-which I never received and had to request from the bartender by walking up myself. Something was wrong with it-it had an irregular smoky taste to it which tasted different than the bloody mary my friend had ordered earlier. Bad mix? Unmixed mix? I didn't think it was a house mix but I sent it back and switched to beer. Ah. Cold bottled goodness. 
The waitstaff disappeared throughout our stay-things like forks and drinks went missing. We would order drinks from one of the several wait staff that was floating randomly around and then they just didn't appear. We had to get them ourselves from the bartender. Then, now over a half hour since the initial drink order, the waiter told us our beers would be right there. Um-ok. The bartender had no issue in the 30 seconds it took him to open the friggen bottles. 
Oh-taps were inoperational for the beginning of our stay. Nearing the end, I suppose they got them working again-gave us warm, flat beer in warm glasses that tasted like soap. Or something weird and not right. Apparently this place does not believe in ""cold frosty mugs from the freezer"" to serve beer in. You do burgers and beer and don't have cold glasses? Hmmmm. 
Ah yes-and they revealed at the last second that the credit card machine was not working. More evidence that this place is an absolute mess. And the ATM in house was broken. 
Sigh. I really, really wanted to like this place. It has actually gotten worse over time. The service and food here were awful. If I ever go back again, I would love to update this review to a more positive one. Previous visits were a dingy environment made up for by good burgers and beers and a wait staff that seemed to know what they were doing. This time, I left here very sad. The bartender seemed on point, the wait staff has zero clue of what is going on.",0
"If you are looking for a wide and unique variety of teas, this place has got you covered. With a counter of wall to wall cannisters teas, you can pretty much walk up to a worker and tell them what you like and they will pull out the best thing ever. 
I was walking by on a humid day and they handed tea samples outside the store. I grabbed on and took a sip. It was hot. I was sweating. It was humid outside. But i stopped and went into the store becuase I had to have the tea that I just tasted. Cream of Earl Grey. Do yourself a favor and get a batch for those cold wintry nights where a hot chocolate just wont suffice. This creamy and decadent tea makes me feel fancy. And cozy. 
Speaking of cozy, i also stocked up on some cold 911 tea because when i found myself sick last year with the flu during flu season, this miracle tea was sold out. Its packed with echinechea, lemon and euchalyptus to sooth sore throats and releive sinus congestion. 
It doesnt have to be medicinal either. Care for a refreshing fruity tea? They got that too!!",0
"This place was recommended to us so we decided to give it a try.  Very nice inside, good waiters, nice menu.  My steak was very tough, and it was either the steak or the salad that gave me food poisoning. I don't necessarily fault them for that as it can happen anywhere but it wasn't cheap and due to the toughness of the steak and the price I, in good conscience, cannot recommend it.",1
"This place is really a 3.5, it was good but TOO MUCH GOOD. I feel about this place the same way i feel about Sand Diego's Hash House A Go Go, its just too rich, too much, just shy of sickening. Like those places you eat and seeing food after makes you want to barf. I ate here at about 2 and couldn't eat again till 9am the next day.  But the ribs were cooked to perfection the meat fell right off the bone and was complemented perfectly with the sauce. The pulled pork was great and the mac and cheese had a great kind of savory sour note to it. I liked the spices on the sweet potatoes although I would say in general the salt potatoes were too salty and the sweet too sweet. I this place could be a a 4 star, if i didnt feel like their plan was the just clog your arteries with one visit.",0
"I've given this place several chances because I really wanted to like it. Not only is this spot two blocks from my apartment, it has a cool vibe and the owner is incredibly friendly. 

That being said, I was preeettty taken aback by my last couple of experiences. To note, Teany's is really small, so even when it's full (which never happens), it shouldn't take much effort to make sure all tables are tended to. We were one of 3 tables around noon on a Saturday and I literally had to walk up to the front counter to get our waitress' attention. By the time our food arrived, we were starving and promptly dug in.....BIG mistake. Two bites in to my salad, I noticed a red fuzz was covering my greens. I said something to my friends, and they too started finding bits of red fuzz throughout their salads. GROSS. Our waitress took the entrees off of our bill, but we were all sick to our stomachs the rest of the afternoon.

Bad experience #2: My friend and I were desperate for dessert at 9 p.m. on a Sunday when most places were closed. Teany's was still open, so we popped in to check out the menu once more. Ice cream caught my eye. Ice cream is safe, right? Nope. Wrong. I ordered two scoops of hazelnut for $3.50 a scoop and was literally served two spoonfuls of melted cream in a glass cup. I ate the entire thing in 10 seconds....and I wasn't racing my friend. $7 for some flavorless mush. Super.

I was rooting for you, Teanissimo....wudda shame.",1
"I was relaxing in my bed at around 6:30 pm and was ready for a nap. My girlfriend came into the bedroom and said, ""BABE COME ON GET UP! WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT; ALL WEEK LONG YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO CHECK OUT THE SPOTTED PIG."" After 20 minutes of laying down I got dressed quickly and we were ready to go. 

I had decided to drive into the city from Astoria since the place was all the way on the Westside. Finding parking in this area was truly a mentally and physically challenging task in itself. After looking for parking for 45 minutes we were starving and walked over to the Spotted Pig at 8pm. 

Upon arrival to the Spotted Pig I then met our hostess or host? Sebastian. I nick named him Sebastian due to this Diesel Short Short Jeans, poor attitude and poor customer service skills. I do not know what his real name is but Sebastian seemed fitting for him.  Sebastian told us it would be a 90 minute wait for a table. We figured we were already here. Why not? We heard great things. I put my name down; he took my number and said he would call me. We walked around the city for a little bit and then stopped by a bar called the Dublin Pub I believe.  We got a couple drinks and then headed back to the Spotted Pig. We were hoping that the wait time was better.

At 9pm we were greeted by Sebastian again. He informed us that it would be another 30-45 minutes for a table. His hands were flailing around and I let my girlfriend handle the situation. I was irritated enough already and do not do well in those types of situations. The bar and place were packed!  Every step we went people were bumping into us. Waiters would walk by with food and we were starving. Luckily I bumped into someone I knew at the bar that was also waiting hours for a table. 

My girlfriend would walk over to Sebastian every 20 minutes or so hoping for some good news. Sebastian was quite indifferent and did not seem to care that we were waiting for 2 hours for a cheese burger.  He was unapologetic and was doing an awful job.

We FINALLY got seated at around 10:15-10:30pm. Yes we actually had to wait around 2  1/2 hours for a table!  The quarters were pretty close and we were basically sitting on top of the people next to us. There were a lot of tourists and asshole hipsters there giving us dirty looks. I am born and raised in New York City and do not care about you. 

We got our food at around 10:45pm. We got an order of deviled eggs and chicken liver toast for appetizers which were banging. We both ordered the burger that everyone ranted and raved about. I wasn't really impressed with the burger.  It was just a normal burger; the cheese was a bit too strong. The shoe string fries were normal fries you can get at Outback. My girlfriend said she would have preferred a burger from FIVE GUYS or SHAKE SHACK instead and I agreed with her. 

Over all the food was pretty good but the service and wait time were PUTRID. Sebastian needs a reality check and needs to purchase a pair of pants. I think it's safe to say that all the employees there need one (everyone else was wearing pants). If you want to get a sick burger go to the OLD HOMESTEAD. The Kobe burger is sick. It is expensive but you will get your money's worth and get GREAT service. You also won't probably wait 2  1/2 hours to be seated. 

I finally got home at 12:30am. 6 hours earlier I wish I would have ordered a burger from the Bel-Aire Diner and relaxed in my apartment in my basketball shorts for the rest of the evening.

CHECK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU WRECK YOURSELF SPOTTED PIG! DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE!",0
"I concur with another Yelper.

In the passing of my food travels one tossed salad at $6.50 was despicable horrible!!  The customer service was entirely cold, impersonal, rude, callous, and very unwelcoming.  When asked about my order for one toss salad, the server immediately started to put a lot of veggies (peppers, cherry tomatoes) into the mixing bowl without asking what I want.  I do not like peppers and I am not a fan of cherry tomatoes but I prefer sliced tomatoes.  How is it that a complete and total stranger know what I want in my tossed salad WITHOUT asking what I want/like?  EEK!! I requested Honey Mustard, which I got, and on the side I also got mayonnaise.  As the day worn on, this salad resulted in one giant case of diarrhea and a date with the porcelain throne.

Upon payment I requested a takeout menu which the cashier turned away from me shouting at his coworker in Spanish only to go into deaf ears as there was no response.  Thereby upon payment I asked, yet again, for a takeout menu only to finally receive a measly response ""no.""  The staff have extremely poor people skills and absolutely no communication skills.  EEK!!",1
"This is GROUPON ONLY place-- a category I just made up for overpriced places that you won't regret going to if you get a discount.

Mix of locals and others. Good, friendly,  bartenders, which is a huge plus, especially for the neighborhood. The waiters --as they say in Italian -- NOTTASOHOTTA. They are nice, but are either dumb girls who don't know ANYTHING (do NOT expect them to know anything about booze other than what they see on the menu...I asked once what Amaros they had, and she stared at me blankly. AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT!!!), or they seem like runners filling in for the REAL waiter who called in sick.  Best to sit at the bar here. The cocktail list isn't bad, considering that 9th ave Hell's Kitchen is a culinary and mixological wasteland these days.

They recently changed their menu, it seems, to accommodate tourists and bridge & tunnel people, with cliché ""Italian American"" dishes. ZZZZZZ. Why don't we just all go to Carmines or the Olive Garden instead?

Lots of great Groupon deals. In which case, ignore everything I said and go, because it will be a great deal for what you pay. 

INSOMMA: 2.5. Not the real deal, but not terrible. Nice staff. Groupon it.",0
"SO GOOD. I'ev been coming here for almost three years and never getting sick of their menus!

But don't go here for breakfasts or lunch menus.... Strangely, in the morning I guess the cooks are not feeling energetic or something, but the menu they serve in the earlier time were usually not that great",0
"Ew, Ew & double EW!  I came in with a friend on a Saturday night for dessert and this place was practically empty.  We had to wait a year and a day before someone came over to us ( I was on the verge of walking out).  Finally, we ordered a piece of cake that we decided to share just to see if we would like it.  It was called 'Death By Chocolate.""  I can't even begin to describe how disgusting this cake was.  It must have been at least a week old.  The cake was hard like a rock so was the pudding and so called mousse.  Hopefully, their other desserts are not as sickening, but with this first experience being such a horror, I wouldn't want to go back to find out.",0
"Window displays r always beautiful! All their food is beautiful. That said the food is very, very sweet. Every single thing I've tried, at this point: chocolate covered pretzels, cheesecake, tirimisu, chocolate cake, red velvet cake and an apple tart were all VERY sweet, as I couldn't finish them without getting that tingly, sugar rush feeling and kinda sick to my stomach. I think they actually add sugar to their chocolate...The coffee is quite good. It's worth going just for the coffee. And the people r VERY nice too ;)",0
"Do not get the calamari. It was bad enough that it was under seasoned but it made me and my friend sick to boot. The vodka penne was good, but nothing spectacular.",1
"Went here for lunch today and we were VERY satisfied. I was feeling a bit sick and was in the mood for some soup (which is rare). Were seated right away and served with tea, yummy tea. I ordered the large chicken noodle soup and it was perfect! Full of flavor, I loved the ginger shavings and the chicken meat was great, noodles were right on. Had a bite of my husbands shrimp dumpling, wasn't crazy about the dumpling wrap but the inside was superb! 
Only draw back was when we asked to pay they wouldn't take our card since our meal was less than $25, so I had to go to the ATM next door ($2.50 fee) to pay. Definitely recommend.",0
jamba juice...like crack.  prices keep going up but you keep coming back for more.  so yummy esp when youre sick.  all that fruit and vitamin c.  only come when theres a bogo deal otherwise its too expensive.  so this location is alright.  quick and get the order right.  no complaints there.,0
"There was only 1 other table besides ours when we went in for dinner. The server was asking how we were when another woman whispers in his ear while pointing and looking at us. We were immediately concerned over what she was saying. There was no way it was anything like ""make sure you treat them well"" or she wouldn't be whispering. I don't know what possessed us to stay. We had the fish and it was just okay. We were concerned the food was tampered with from the whispering. Fortunately, neither of us got sick but there is no way we will return. Why stop our server, look and point at us and whisper something in his ear right in front of us? We talked about it afterwards and came to the conclusion that if we return we are just begging for them to make us sick. I don't know what her problem was with us but she did not shy away from showing it.",0
"First off, the guy behind the pizza counter had his iPod in so when I ordered he spoke so low I couldn't hear him. I had to ask what he said several times and each time he was unintelligible. The guy sitting nearby on break finally spoke up to tell me what the other guy was saying. The pizza was huge but meh. The slices are so large and meh that I got tired of eating them and felt sick a few bites into each slice which had never happened before.The vodka sauce pizza was bland and greasy I had to blot it  and I saw other people doing the same to their pizza. The mushroom was ok at first but then disgusting. The original and the deep dish with tomato and basil were ok but nothing special. I'm going to have to blame the grease from the vodka sauce pizza on the horrible shits and gas we all had later. No thanks.",1
"Review on delivery only.

I'm convinced they have little elves who fly on magical unicorns at the speed of light who deliver your food. I live around 10 blocks and 2 avenues away (please don't stalk me) and food was somehow delivered to my door 17 minutes after I placed the order. 

I would also like to note that I've hated thai food eversince a bout of food poisoning throughout a trip in Thailand 10 years ago. PTSD, okay!? But Leng Thai, you just might have changed my mind....

Got the Cee Yew Noodle, which was surprisingly dry with good flair. The broad noodles weren't a sticky ball of wet goop like most Thai places. I drizzled sauce from the Massaman Curry onto it (had a nice thick sauce). Delicious combo!",0
"Aki gets three and a half stars and the half star bump up because, it is what it is.

Aki is a discount sushi place with decent sushi.

There is a lot of competition on the block for sushi.  Aki is the clear price winner, hands down, blind folded.

There is no pretentious anything at Aki.  They have a menu.  They are well decorated and clean.  They half half price sushi.  They will take your order then leave you to whatever it is you do besides eat.  The rolls are really well priced.

Every salmon combination I have tried is good, including the New York roll with apple and mayo.

If you are looking to impress someone, there are places with nicer decor on the block.  If you want to eat, not break the bank and get a pretty no frills, cheap experience, without worrying about getting sick or having gas station like sushi, Aki wins hands down.  As a discount sushi spot, it gets four stars.  It is what it is, and it doesn't pretend to be what it is not.",0
"Clarke's is near my office and our lunch group was looking for a different take out- sick of soup & salads. Ordered a Burger cooked Medium with fries and a drink, pretty good deal for $9 in midtown. It was ready really quickly, went back to the office and bit in to it- it was completely raw, the meat was red and crumbling. I decided to call and tell them and surprisingly the customer service was great. They found my 15 minute old order, and offered to re-make the burger and deliver it to my office. In less than 15 minutes they delivered a new burger (cooked!) and fries. When it's cooked- pretty tasty burger!",0
"Zero stars for this place. Went there for the first time last week, loved it! Super excited to see a gluten free option. No problems on visit one. Today, I went in there to order two different orders, one was gluten free. I took my order home and was surprised to see ""gf"" on the order that should have been regular. Basically they reversed them. I luckily didn't eat them bc of course I would have been really sick. I called to get a credit for the food that I threw out and the person who answered the phone blamed me! Apparently I should have made it more clear that I was allergic to gluten... Ummmm you have a gluten free menu, isn't that enough? She then continues to blame me for not saying I was allergic! Again-- you have a gluten free menu! Not one apology-- rude rude rude rude. Keep it up! Park slope customers won't deal with your nonsense. I'm looking forward to seeing my credit on my card. 
All in all- if you have a gluten allergy-- apparently a REAL allergy then I'd stay away. For anyone else, the food was good the first time- so if you have nothing to worry about then go for it! Otherwise, I wouldn't take the chance :)",0
"36th and broadway location - I dunno. I had the mediterranean quinoa salad. It wasn't that good for me. The quinoa seems like it wasn't cooked right, way too much moisture and the kale was rubbery probably cause of their quick blanching process. the dressing was mustardy tasting. Other than that it was kinda bland. I dont think it was tossed properly cause the ingredient weren't mixed well. It just didn't taste right. I'd probably give it a second chance but usally when I get a quinoa salad I go to Cafe Blossom, more expensive but leaps and bounds better.

UPDATE: Threw half of it out. Had to call out sick the remainder of the day. Probably won't return. My suspicion something with the kale and how dry kale was being dipped in the same hot water bath, of course the quinoa was water logged. I dunno but I'm taking a half day cause of it.",1
"I had a lunch here and I was hungrier when I finished than I had been before walking in. Slow service, horrifying pad thai. There's no word to describe the oily and disgusting taste of badly-cooked, non-fresh meat in English as far as I know, but there is one in Chinese and it's ?. I'm a meat-lover but after that pad thai, I swear the thought of becoming a vegetarian crossed my mind. My friend who was present for the lunch asked me if I was sick and I had to tell him yes, but the real reason was: I'm sick because the food here made me so.

I've had pad thai in many places (including in Thailand, too!), and this is the first place in my memory that could f*** up a dish so simple as the pad thai. What I wanted to tell the chef but wasn't able to say in front of my friends was: man, you were able to ruin the safest order of Thai food. That's something.

It's now an hour after my lunch and I'm still feeling sick. I feel I can throw up any minute, and I genuinely regret every bit of that pad thai I ate out of politeness. If I weren't with my friends I'd have returned the dish to the chef and refused to pay. This was the most disgusting lunch ever.",1
"I told the guy not to make my food spicy I said no do not make it spicy you can add a little bit of spice but not too spicy.... Well unfortunately he dumped the whole red hot pepper in there and I couldn't even eat my food and then he looks at me with a dumb grin...  I told him don't you understand me I said not too spicy he said yes it wasn't spicy. I told him look how I couldn't even eat as evidenced by my plate full of noodles I can only eat the meat and the meat wasn't that spicy. I told him look at all the noodles I left on my plate but he just looked at me with a stupid grin. I'll never go back here. .Boo!!

***UPDATE***  I ended up becoming really sick from the massive amount of hot spicy pepper that basically ruined my food. I had stomach aches/cramps and diarrhea for 3 days after. It was such a shame because after wiping down a few noodles and cleaning off the hot pepper from the meat, the food actually tasted good.",1
"The Google map on this Yelp page has this bar located in the water, off the ferry station, with a question mark.

Accurately describes where this bar belongs. 

I went on a Wednesday night after volunteering in the area, thinking, it's not even 9pm; surely we'll have the bar to ourselves and have us a good, pleasant night.

Or not.

The loudest, grossest douchebags lined the bar, way more intoxicated than socially acceptable for a Wednesday night. Therefore, they spoke and laughed way louder than necessary, so the bartendress had to turn up the music, which only made them louder, which only made it more difficult for everyone in the bar to hear each other talk. Then one yelled, ""Does anyone here have a condom? Size small, for my friend here!"" And of course, they all bellowed, and I wondered if they even liked each other as people. Probably not. 

I excused myself to the restroom, where I was greeted by vomit in the sink. And it wasn't fresh; it had dried up enough for me to know it'd be sitting there for a while. I looked up at the ceiling while I used the toilet to prevent myself from puking in response. Back downstairs, I told one of the bartendresses and she said she'd clean it up. Not sure if she did, since she had to get more rounds of shots for the douchebags. Hey, at least she made money for the night. 

I pray to Jesus that I never have to go back here. I certainly won't be recommending it to anyone.",0
"I ordered food from this place last night. I really wanted Ethiopian food and I usually get it at Meskel in the neighborhood. However, I decided to give this place a Try. Never again! First, it takes about 5 minutes to place an order. The girl had no pen, once she found one to write down my address she was ready to take my order. I wanted the combo for one but I was told I can only do one meat if its raw with two veggies. I said ok - no big deal. I love the kiofta! One hour later, my food arrived. Somehow, the food ended up being over $18 (price was $15 on the website). Not sure how much they charged for tax, but I was not going to argue with a delivery boy over $2. I gave him $25 and he said thank and wanted to walk away. I asked for $2 back. He wasn't very happy but he handed me the change and left. I was ready to forget about the whole experience and i was excited to finally eat my food. It was disgusting! Meat was old, veggies had no taste or flavor... Injera was ok. I was sick all might from it. Conclusion: NEVER again!!!",1
"I heard really good things about this restaurant and decided to go there with 
some friends. We were there towards the end of the evening so many of the 
entrees on the pre-fix menu had run out. Which was fine. So I decided to order 
the seafood mix with the polenta ( not sure the correct name) which was on the 
prefix menu. When I received my dish I had one nice round polenta and two 
others. I had never eaten polenta before so I thought nothing of it when I saw 
misshaped, missing pieces of the other two. I realized later that the missing 
pieces were spoon marks of eaten pieces from someone else :(. One of the polenta pieces was mostly eaten. I feel really sick that I had eaten someone else's throw away!  How could a restaurant go so low to have served me someone else's left over eaten food.  I was too embarrassed at the time and shocked that I didn't say anything.  Now I am just 
disgusted and very upset!   I have sent an email to them and no response.",1
"My 9 year old daughter and I went there yesterday. It was an emergency she was feeling ill and asked to use their bathroom. I offered to purchase something in order to compensate since most place do not allow you to use their facilities without purchase.

They flat out refused. They did not care that this little girl was sick, they wanted no part of it and asked us to leave. THEY WERE INCREDIBLY RUDE! NOT CHILD FRIENDLY. DO NOT BOTHER TO GIVE BUSINESS TO THESE HEARTLESS INDIVIDUALS. 

Based on other reviews below it seems their staff are just as mean to adult as they are to little kids. 

Save your money and go elsewhere.",0
"I've gotten sick the last two times I've ordered from here, including yesterday.

An anonymous but firm (but not nasty) letter should go out to the owner/management about this; concerning a variety of restaurants in the past I've confronted owners and/or management about getting sick from their respective businesses but it's always met with eye avoidance and denial which is why a letter is generally better; it's all a ""one-way"" conversation.

Chef Ramsay has showed us the ""back of the house"" too many times; maybe he and his camera crew should show up here, too.",1
"I ordered two bento boxes, 1 vegetable gyoza (dumpling), and one california roll. Everything was okay besides the vegetable gyoza. The gyoza had meat in there. I am vegetarian and do not eat meat. When I called to tell them there is meat in there they would not believe me. I said I am looking at pink chewy meat because I tried some. Then I asked whats in it and the manager said cabbage and carrots.... There was a lot of other stuff they just didnt know. I said if there was only two things in there I would not be calling. Then I said ask the chef whats in there again. The chef said the gyoza is green which means its only vegetables. They also told me they get the gyoza's from somewhere else. The chef only fry's it. So how would he know whats in there anyway. It can be someone else's error that doesnt care. And they still refused to send me something else saying its impossible that can never happen. I told them dont send me anything, just come take this back so you can see what Im talking about. This place makes me sick literally. I dont eat meat which means it doesnt sit well. They messed up and I feel so bad for the other vegetarians that have to have meat in their food. In reality this can be a legal matter for this place but with this review I will let them correct their mistake!",1
"first time.  super nice wait staff.  just OK cocktails  I would say the appetizers / small plates are better than entree. got the ""seared tuna"" that instead of rare was medium.  not  very good and with an hour of getting back to my hotel I probably sh@! everything I had eaten.  I guess I got a mild case of food poisoning.  might give it another try sometime.",1
I haven't had coffee from here that I didn't like. Iced voodoo child has a sick kick and is perfect for summer but their latte is pretty awesome for me also. I buy the stumptown hairbender from them to brew at home also.,0
"The cuban pulled pork sandwich was alright. Pretty dry and bland. The french vegetable soup with tofu was very good and made me feel instantly better (I was sick). The prawn taco was alright. The quacamole was alright. The place itself was really cute, the staff was great, and the breakfast looks amazing, but I didn't get a chance to try it. Self-serve water, pay at the counter, grab your own utensils.",0
"The Frying Pan is definitely not for those who suffer from sea sickness or constant rocking of the ship/boat but you'll have a great experience overall. Went there on a nice, hot summer day, met up with friends, had to order fries because that alone was pricey ($5 or $10 if I remember) but it tasted awesome. Also had sangria which was very good. The design of the bathrooms below the deck was decent and efficient. I went around 7pm on a Sunday so there was a crowd but it wasn't too little nor too big a crowd. The only downside is finding a place to sit even though the boat/ship is huge! So you may have to send a friend early to save a table or sit for ya. And the views of the Hudson/NJ area with a sunset is too pretty to pass up!",0
"Tenzan used to be my favorite UWS sushi spot.  It never let me down. 

However the last two delivery orders arrived and portions of my Yellow tail Special were warm. After the first occurrence I was sick for two days. Waited several weeks to try again tonite.  Not as bad as first time but fish freshness was NOT there. I always order miso with no seaweed yet the last two times it was loaded with it.  What gives?  You used to provide stellar service on customer requests.  What happened? 

I feel like something has changed at this once bright spot. Maybe management or supervising the sushi bar?  Whatever it is they need to fix it fast otherwise they won't last.",1
"Finally some authentic Chinese food. I was getting so sick of take out! Get the triple vegetable dish in chili sauce, spicy peanut noodles, and general tso chicken (huge pieces of white meat with thin breading and delicious sauce). The sliced pork belly wasn't too shabby either. Bottles of wine are very cheap!",0
"Super good, but maybe almost too rich?  I get sick of it if I go too often.   Kale salad is amazing.  Veggie ramen is very good, and purportedly vegan, though that's hard to believe.",0
"i have to say that this is a nice sushi place but i had to order around 4 times delivery and 2 of them was good and two was not nice, i will explain: sushi was nice all 4 times , fresh , exept one time the seaweed salad made me really sick for whole night , and complain number 2 that delivery guy gives only half change, one time i didnt count and he took for tip 15 BUKS!!! seriously?! and last time was about to do the same but i told him to give me more change, if he cannot count the money tell him to take calculator with him , my order was for one person only what the ...
anyway how good was the sushi i will have to find other place for delivery cos that last seaweed salad caused me a big problem at night out",1
"I dined here at least once a week.  Don't know how much longer I can tolerate the atrocious service.  Management to the bartender are beyond rude.  I also don't appreciate a sick bartender coughing and sniffling while handling my drinks and food.

I will go elsewhere where the service is in line with the high prices.  The management and servers at The Arlington club belong at a cheap sports bar, not at a classy UES expensive steak house.",0
"I ate this while drunk and it was DELICIOUS. The lamb and rice paired perfectly with the white sauce. Split this with my friend. I am still drunk so I will go here whilst sober and see if it's still as good.


UPDATE A WEEK LATER: Demoted to 3 stars. Why? Because I tried this while sober. When drunk, this is the food of the gods and the best thing you will ever taste. When sober, it is cheap greasy bland street meat that not even the white sauce (too acidic this time!) can mitigate.
Go here if you....
- are drunk
- are EXTREMELY hungry
- have just completed strenuous exercise

And, in my sober state, I am worried that I will contract food poisoning....


UPDATE 3 WEEKS LATER: I got drunk again and this sounded like a good idea. Not only was I drunk, but I hadn't eaten in 24 hours. The combination of drunkness + extreme hunger made this fantastic. In that state, I ate the ENTIRE PLATTER + a shit ton of white sauce. Afterwards I wanted to die.",0
"This tiny cafe located in NYC has some great tasting caffeinated drinks! Sick of starbucks and other major chain stores? This is recommended alternative.

If you are in the area, you'll be pleasantly satisfied with their coffee. Come check this place out!

Have a great day Yelp!",0
"Definitely, easily one of the worst burgers i've ever had. 

I had both the truffle burger and the california burger.

The california burger is the primary reason for this bad review. 

The california burger was disgusting. It tasted weird and funky. 

It made my burger not taste like beef. I don't know what kind of sauce they put in that, but it is totally disgusting. 

I felt like vomiting after eating that. 

The truffle burger was only slightly better. It didn't have the lettuce or tomatoes . It was basically meat and bun with a freaking u stamped on it. I don't give a damn about the fancy logo if the meat tastes like crud. 

The truffle fries, god this was awfully weird tasting, its like they put too much truffle oil on it or something. tasted funky. 

I personally am insulted that the reviewers on here would give this place a 4. 

Must be either the classic or manly burger tastes better most likely. 

But the two i ordered definitely suck. I had these cooked well done though. so i'm not sure if it tastes better raw or something? 

Seriously disgusting and they don't even have mayo, they just have garlic aoli or whatever which looks like mayo. DISGUSTING!!!!

Shake shack is 10 x better. even burger king , even golden arches ( mickey d).",0
"What's the to say about a Mexican restaurant run by Chinese that hasn't been said about Chinese restaurants run by Mexicans?  I think both ethnic groups know what food's suppose to taste like.  Now whether what they gave me was healthy food,  that's another discussion.  I had the chicken guacamole lunch special.  Not bad,  but not as good as the trucks they have uptown.  It is authentic,  more than what most Mexican restaurants in the city are like,  but there was just something lacking,  was it spice?  Cilantro? Jalapeños?  Maybe all of that and more.  But for $6, I could have eaten 6 slices at the dollar pizza place nearby and felt sick afterwards.  So yeah,  I think it's worth a meal on the bends, but not a place I would plan around to take out from.",0
"What did I leave this restaurant with? A cool, souvenir glass cup that comes complimentary with any alcoholic drink, and food poisoning.

Don't be fooled into the aesthetically pleasing style of the restaurant with its fancy bar lights and cool Mexican theme, it's a trap.

They claim to have the best guacamole in NYC but it's nothing but ordinary. It's tasty but I've definitely had better. As for the entrees, they're burritos and quesadillas are quite gross. I feel bad saying that the food is so bad, but really, don't go here. My burrito was filled with gooey cheese that was barely discernible between what I thought was sour cream and american cheese, and the beans are flavored with some $2 McCormick ready made spice bags. As for the side of cheese we got for our fries, it was definitely tostitos cheese from the can. How disgusting.

But, the only reason I'm giving two stars and not one is because of the drinks. They're drinks are $13 for a hefty size and a good amount of alcohol. And you get to keep the souvenirs glass!

Service: not too bad. Food came fast (not surprised for that considering everything they served us was probably from a can).

Overall, maybe go for drinks but that's really it. The food made me sick to my stomach and left me with cramps for the night and the day after!",1
"I went to this establishment since I heard so many good things about it. Boy, were they wrong. The service was bad, the $36 crab legs weren't seasoned/cooked properly and drinks came in a small plastic cup, like the ones you get at the dentists office. Worst of all, after I left, the food got me sick! I was unable to hold anything down the rest of the night. All I can say is this will be my first and last time attending this establishment.",1
"This place is so under-rated!  It never disappoints.  Whenever I'm feeling a little cold coming on my spouse and I head there immediately for the pho.  It's always soothing.  When we're not sick and we're just looking for good food at a good price, we head here for their over-rice-entrees.  We usually range from the chicken lemongrass to basil chicken to grilled chicken to cubed beef to curry.  They are very consistent with their flavors so ou never have a bad meal.  The portions do not disappoint.  I know of other viet restaurants that skimp out on the chicken or beef over time.  By now I'm sure the waiters know us because we frequent the place so much.  Sometimes I swear they give us an extra serving of chicken or beef.  The spring rolls are a must too!  We've also tried their pad thai and young chow fried rice and they are pretty good too!  In my book, this is the best restaurant for flavor and price.  You cannot get any better than this.",0
"IT'S A TRAP! (The squid)

Mediocre at best. Diarrhea inducing at worst. Avoid drunk man's noodle. I think the squid got me.",1
"I really hate leaving bad reviews, BUT I really tried to find the positive aspects of this place. Normally, I don't go to non-vegan restaurants unless I am with non-vegan people and I don't want to be a brat by insisting we go elsewhere, I'm not a snob, I'm just tired of getting sick from misunderstandings and cross contamination. I mean, I love diarrhea as much as the next guy, but...I digress.
 
Anyway, as a server, I try to give other servers some slack, but our server was annoyed from the beginning to hear that there were a few vegans at the table. I asked what my options were as it said ""vegan options available"" on the menu. He said there weren't really any options. My boyfriend ordered some plain pasta with tomato sauce which came out with cheese, Ay yi yi. Our server disappeared a whole lot, so another server graciously remedied the pasta and ran our card at the end of the meal after he saw us trying to pay for a long time. We left a good tip because people in the service industry can't tip below a certain percentage without nightsweats, but we handed the other server some cash and thanked him for saving us.   

BUZZKILLS: Vegans are not welcome.",0
"My son's class went to this farm (if it can be called such!) on Monday 10/7/13.  I was horrified! The poor animals chained by the neck with heavy chains and locks looking sickly and sad crammed in a box where they cannot lay down if they chose to. One of the little girls in my son's class began crying when yet another cow barely had the strength to eat it's hay and she wanted us to unchain it and take it to the ""doctor."" The chickens in the coop are SICK!  One literally keeled over and died. A few moments later another keeled over!  I began screaming for my son to get the hell out of the coop as I saw other chickens were sick. The teachers then began screaming for their students to get out as well. My son's teacher went to complain about what happened and the condition of the farm animals. She was given several tickets to return in the future. She offered me a few tickets and I absolutely refused.  My son is now sick.  He has been vomiting for the last 3 days and the doctor believes it may be a parasite. Is it from this hell hole?  Who knows, but the doctor is running every lab test imaginable to rule it out.  I am DEFINITELY calling every health and animal agency I can think of!!!",0
"Disgrasian- a person who brings shame or loss of respect, honor, or reputation to their race

I rarely if ever write one star reviews but this one is truly worthy if the situation ever presented itself.  3-4 months ago I booked a reservation for a party of 70 of my closest family and friends for a dinner and a deposit was made and penciled into the calendar.  This place had been used in the past by former family and friends for similar gatherings so I felt despite the mixed yelp reviews, this place was a known quantity.  Imagine my surprise when 1 month prior to the reservation, I get a phone call from the manager not asking but TELLING me that we were bumped to their basement floor since they had a larger party that wanted to reserve the main floor and his comment was ""You understand how it is right? (subtext: you're chinese, you know how we are...)  Ummm....NO, there is nothing Chinese or Asian about not honoring an agreement with a deposit for the sake of making more money.  He pretty much said take it or leave it since there was no room for negotiations or a discount.  Due to lack of time in rescheduling a new venue since we were planning this dinner from out of town, I had my sister (who is a local) evaluate the basement floor and it actually looked presentable and had added privacy, although I was still steaming based on principle.

Fast forward to the day of the dinner a few weeks ago, the manager finally showed a shred of remorse and offered to throw in an extra dish....but it never came.  We gave them a headcount of around 70 so with tables fitting 10 people, we were expecting to pay for 7 tables.  Upon arrival, there was an assortment of medium and large tables so that some tables fit 10 whereas others fit 7-8.  They then proceeded to charge us for 8 tables and blamed us for seating ourselves even though we clearly were feeding the equivalent of 7.  How many Asian 3rd graders do you need to make this calculation?  No real complaints actually about the food (cue in ominous foreshadowing music...) and we then reach the classic end of a chinese banquet with a sweet dessert soup.  Imagine the shock and horror when the soup is presented before us served not in bowls, but in CHEAP PLASTIC CUPS?!  I'm pretty sure in the history of Chinese banquets, this has never been done and the emperor would have surely rolled heads back in the day.  If you ran out of silverware or bowls, you are much better omitting the last course than to trudge out this embarrassing spectacle.

However, I've saved the coup de grace for last.  Fast forward 30hrs post dinner, and imagine the outrage when I'm informed 23 of the guests who attended this dinner were either vomiting or having diarrhea all night (including my mother who wasn't sure she was well enough to catch the plane back home).  You don't need a statistics guru to figure out the source so the NY department of Health got involved and recently isolated a virus from stool samples (how's that for a thank you for coming to dinner?).  Not sure if it was from the food or contaminated employees who didn't wash their hands, but there are no words to describe the disaster this experience was for nearly all involved.  If there was a floor for one star yelp reviews, I think I may have found it and subsequently discovered the Marianas Trench happens to lie below it and that's where you will find this establishment.",1
"I was there for a party so there it wasn't a full menu available to me. Of those choices I got the Smoked BBQ burger. Not bad, for a BBQ burger (not a big fan of BBQ sauce.) The sauce wasn't super overpoweringly sweet, just a little tangy and I thought it went really well with the burger and bacon. The gouda was just all right, not a lot of strong flavor but the rest of it was pretty tasty. 

The fries were good, but I could have used more, probably because my gf kept stealing fries off my plate. 

Service was pretty good, turned out she was the manager covering for some of her employees who were sick or on vacation. I don't want to rate it higher since my visit wasn't the normal experience. Forest Hills isn't a place I go to often but it's a place I'll keep bookmarked to come back to.",0
I used to like the place but I must say this one and the one on northern blvd both stink greasy salty lousy food never again makes me sick,0
I wish I could give this place a zero... The cook/owner(?) cooks in shorts and a dirty t-shirt. That was a clue to just order coffee and leave. Not getting sick in a place that has no business in the food business. Weird weird place nothing but old timers always in front of the place just hanging out. Mafia hang???,0
"So I've been hanging out in Astoria now for roughly about almost 3 years and am familiar with the Long Island City/Astoria part, the Steinway area (my fave!) and the Broadway into Ditmars part. I've seen Doyle's bar and walked by it now for almost a year and a half at this point...since July when my boyfriend moved up the block from this bar. 

It looks like a regular, Irish pub from the outside - charming, yet being a Manhattan native I've seen my share of Irish pubs and each time I walked by I wanted to hop in, but didn't because well...no real reason, but with so many bars in the area we just never made it in here.

Last Friday I went to my beau's apartment from work, he wasn't home as he was doing laundry to prepare for his bestie from CT who was visiting and staying over the next day. We went in the direction of the Laundromat but realized we had 35-40 minutes to kill. He was flushed, a little clammy and not feeling so great. Wasn't entirely sure whether or not he had a fever, but definitely sure he was a little sick or coming down with something. 

He wanted a Hot Toddy and felt it would help make him feel better. I wanted an ice cold beer as I had a rough week, so I suggested Doyle's since it's on the corner and right by his Laundromat. SO HAPPY I did. This charming pub has many redeeming qualities:

1.) Newly remodeled - I had never seen the inside before so I honestly can't speak as to what it was like before, but now it's got comfy booths, dim sexy lighting (not too dark, just right!), simple/minimalistic light fixtures give it a nice, classy pub feel - was totally surprised as the outside (in my opinion) doesn't match the inside, this isn't a bad thing - just an observation.

2.) Bathrooms - Yes, this is a QUALITY. People go to bars to drink, drinks make us want to tinkle. Being able to tinkle in a clean bathroom is all too often a luxury at a bar. I literally stopped in my tracks when I entered a clean smelling bathroom with a squeaky clean new steel sink & faucet, clean toilets, perfectly kept stalls, no graffiti or etchings...it was amazing. One of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen at a bar. Awesome.

3.) Prices - Food menu is your average Irish bar foods, but everything sounds pretty delicious and I've heard that the Irish Nachos here are to die for. I'll definitely check them out next time I'm here. My boy's Hot Toddy (and other cocktails) are $6 (not awful, especially when it's heavy handed and well made). Jameson on the rocks is $6 and beers on draft (imported and domestic) are $6 all day, every day and I was really impressed to see Blue Moon's Agave Nectar on tap here along with Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (a Hefeweizen style beer brewed by Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan in Freising, German) which I totally got my boyfriend into. He described it as ""oooh, that's refreshing!"" and he's right. Not many Irish bars have a spectacular draft beer selection, kudos Doyle's :).

4.) Friendly Bartender - Friday night the man in charge of the bar was Brendan. Brendan is friendly a hoot and gave me a generous sample of Blue Moon's Agave Nectar in a pretty crystal class. He also makes a MEAN Hot Toddy. If I remember correctly he also had a light Irish accent. Winning.

Doyle's is a real neighborhood bar and a great place to WATCH SOCCER on their wall-mounted flat screens, enjoy some food and have a good time away from college frat boys and other annoying folk. 

Also the jukebox here is FANTASTIC and was churning out awesome music - any bar that plays Johnny Cash and Arctic Monkeys gets several golden stars in my book. Love this place and will probably be a regular in no time :).",0
Fresh and clean tasting. Not sickly salty or greasy like so much American Chinese food is. I ordered chicken with cashew - loads of cashews and good flavor. I'll visit again.,0
"Go here only if you want to risk horrible, horrible food poisoning. I should have known from their absolute don't-give-a-shit attitude the quality of the food wasn't going to be high, and it wasn't, from both a taste and hygienic perspective.

I had a subpar-flavored shrimp with garlic sauce and within about three hours the trials began. 102 F fever for two days in a row, hallucinations, vomiting everywhere, sleeplessness... I was about to go to the emergency room but instead called my father, a doctor, who paid me an after-hours visit at the end of the second day of the ordeal. He called two infectious disease experts he knew and they all concluded I had severe Campylobacter poisoning. Look it up, it's no joke. A couple of Cipro antibiotics later, I was holding down saltines with only a 99 F fever, and the worst was behind me.

Never. Ever. EVER again. Ever.",1
"My go to place for Happy Hour Oysters! Their East Coast oysters are bomb! Fish tacos and shishito peppers are not disappointing.  Pretty good.  Love the complimentary chocolate pudding they give you at the end.  I'm not a pudding fan but hey its chocolate plus they give you a small portion so I don't get overly sick of it.  Recently tried the shrimp and avocado slider, definitely try that! For happy hour house wine, the white wine is not too bad.  I actually enjoy it as most house wines are pretty crappy.  Definitely come here for happy hour, if not, dinner here is good as well!",0
"One of the Other Half's favorite calorie-splurge places, so we've eaten there many times over the years.   

- yes, it's expensive -- ~$24 for a breakfast / brunch entree, $7 for french press coffee, etc.  
- food portions are enormous 
- total decadence esp in the carbs zone:  fancy types of french toast, waffles, pancakes, crepes etc.   
- not the place for a diet: you'll be bummed out looking at all the stuff you shouldn't be eating.  That said, they do have fruit, yogurt etc. so you can eat healthy here.  
- mobbed, always.  Either make a reservation or be prepared to wait, potentially for a loooong time.  There are benches to sit but those are often full with other people waiting.  
- some people complain about the service but we've never had a problem -  on the contrary, recently when our food took longer than expected, they brought us a free fruit plate & then ended up comping us our entire meal, which we hadn't even asked them to do.   Which says to me: 1) yes, they are loyalty tracking (they told us when we arrived that they knew we'd been there before) and 2) that being nice generally gets you better results than being nasty.   I've noticed plenty of attitudinal snotty guests at this place, for whatever reason, & I'm sure the waitstaff get plenty sick of it.  

I'm sure we'll keep going there for years to come.",0
"My fiance and I went to Pappardella because she was craving pasta and is gluten free. Our visit went really well, but was marred by a miscommunication in the kitchen which resulted in my fiance eating some regular bread and getting very sick. The owner responded ASAP by apologizing, comping our meal, and asking that we give them another chance. 

Our second visit was excellent and no mishaps. The food at Pappardella is excellent, homemade, slightly inventive, and the experience is quite nice. 

Despite a traumatic first visit, we will surely be visiting them again.",0
"Totally bland. I was craving udon so I had the noodle soup with tofu, spinach and mushrooms. It came in a huge bowl of what was basically just hot water. The tofu was raw and tasted like, well, tofu. This is fine in something like a miso soup in which the base actually has some flavor, but in this soup it was just insulting. Hubs ordered the lotus root and chili pepper but there were no peppers to be seen anywhere. Again, zero flavor. The veggie dumplings were ok once you dipped them in the sauce, but were otherwise meh. 

I'm so sick of chefs who think vegetarians must not like their food to taste like anything. I mean, who do they think they are catering to?",0
"I had dinner at the restaurant on a separate night and had a nice low key dinner. It was a Wednesday. Food was awesome, waitress was super sweet and honest if she was unclear about something and would offer to ask someone else and come back with a response. I admire that- we don't all wake up knowing how to a certain job. I did feel like the people in suits that came up to is were nice and made sure we we enjoying ourselves; however, it seemed like everyone is manager? 

We had a nice dinner so we rounded up a group to the lounge Saturday night. Such a bust! We got there around 11:45. We heard it is the hardest door in the city and it is going to be very very exclusive- love that idea. There was a huge line, got right in. The place hardly got packed, which seemed nice. Music was low key and boring but we figured they're just getting revved up for the night. Wrong! The music was horrible and people were not flocking in, but flocking OUT! I have been to every hot club in Manhattan and we always pay premium for bottle service (I realize how obnoxious that sounds but just helping people out especially ones that love a good night out like myself), but when the music sucks and we are the ONLY ones there by 1:30, there is something wrong. I get the low key music (I'm sick of edm rave like clubs anyhow) but seriously it was music my grandparents listened to. So if they are trying to attract people in their 50's then they should keep doing what they're doing, but for us mid 20's to early 30's better off at electric room or no. 8 especially if you're buying bottle service! They need a new dj ASAP!",0
"It's with sadness that I have to update this review. For a place that had such great promise 2 years ago. Yes it's romantic but if you and your mate are puking from the food it really puts a damper on the ""romance.""

I went back 2 weeks ago and wow has service and the food fell off. Let me say this - I got violently sick from the food. Not sure if it was the truffle Mac and cheese or the unforgettably abysmal pizza. Moreover, they increased their prices significantly to the point where the prices don't match the establishment. Here's my point - Who's going  to pay $20+ for really bad flatbread pizza? It's flatbread with canned tomato sauce spread on top. Really bad tomato sauce at that.

Bottom line... Wine and Roses is good for just that - Wine and Roses.",1
"Since I'm a vegan dessert-deprived person in a city teeming with dairy-filled desserts, I love this place. It's my go-to on a rainy day and gorge myself with delicious food that won't make me feel sick! I loved the mango cheesecake the first time I went. I have this impression that the peanut butter chocolate bomb was like an explosion- very overwhelming. It was a weird battle between peanut butter and chocolate to win your favor by shoving it into your face. The second time I went, I had delicious apple caramel cheesecake but a weird chocolate cake.

I can't remember a thing about the teas though.",0
"I live in the neighborhood and was so excited for the opening of Open Kitchen given our few, albeit growing dining options.  Tonight I ordered from the carving station: turkey with 2 sides.  The turkey, which was sitting out with the other meats, was COLD.  Not just not warm.  COLD.  Which is really concerning given that I took an enormous first bite and am PREGNANT.  And now I am playing wait and see if I get sick game which is bad enough when you are not pregnant.  

PLEASE KEEP YOUR FOOD AT APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURES.  NOT FOR MY SAKE BECAUSE I WILL NEVER BE BACK.",0
"So last night I went to the spot for my girlfriends birthday

Pros:
Food was acceptable
The price of the drinks, especially the margarita pitchers is a steal
Waiter service was nice and quick to respond

Cons:
The place itself was dirty, my girlfriend got sick immediately after eating there. Seriously if the restaurant has a yelp, then read this and make sure the ceiling and vent shafts you have air blowing in are clean.

Some of the policies the establishment have also deter customers from even staying there to eat or even drink. Especially if we are already exceeding the minimum amount asked for when ordering the quantities of alcohol and food. Asking for a minimum per person itself when the bill is most likely going to be near 70-100 dollar range due to the quantity already ordered.

Otherwise give this place a proper inspection, if you see it's cleaned up",1
"So I came today at around 4:15 pm and boy was I super disappointed with this place.  Long story short, I eagerly came in and left with frustration and my stomach turned upside down.  I was actually planning to come here for ages and it was much anticipated and I was also so excited to come here today and then... 

So when I came there was no wait and it was pretty empty since it was the middle of the day (there were like 6 tables maybe?).  The hostess sat my bf and I down and I asked if we can sit near the place with the long couches instead of in the middle where the tables are smaller and my bf and I wanted to sit next to each other.  However, she told me they were going through shift change so I understood and said ok and sat down where she told me to.  Then, a couple of minutes later (less than 5) she sat 2 guys down where my bf and I wanted to sit.  The terrible experience started from here.  We waited about 15 minutes and we still had no one to bring us water or take our order or anything.  We saw that the table that sat down after us in the seats that we wanted get their water and order their food before the waitress even came to our table.  LIKE HELLO WE WERE HERE FIRST... During the time, we tried to waive down 2 waiters and one did not respond and one said he will get the waitress responsible for our table and our waitress didn't come for another like 10 minutes.  Finally after a 20 minute wait we finally got to order and finally got some water after she left and put our order in.  It was quick for the food to come we just ordered thin fries with a truffle burger to share because I had a snack before coming since my bf gets off late.  I thought we were supposed to get dipping sauces with our fries, however when we asked the waiter for some sauce he only brought us some ketchup.  At this point I was beyond disappointed.

Now for the taste of the food I give it probably a 3 (and its averaged from my bf giving the food a 3.5/5 and 4 max).  We both agreed that the truffle burger was good - very flavorful (but he had higher ratings, maybe because he was starving?)  I personally thought that the truffle sauce was a bit too greasy.  Though I did like the flavor, I was not fond of the grease and the meat itself was not really top quality (you can tell from the texture).  The thin fries were bland (maybe because I was upset about the sauce).  But, I did like the crunchy texture and thinness that it possessed.

After the experience here I have to say, customer service is the most important part of any experience, whether it be dining or a stay at the hotel or a spa.  For me, I'm not sure if the customer service was what killed the taste of all the food for me and made me feel that the money spent was wasted because I just felt so sick while eating there and after I ate there I still felt an upset stomach and plenty of frustration.  Don't get me wrong, the staff weren't NOT friendly, but I don't think they are very helpful.  Maybe this establishment lacks efficient customer service?  But, for a brand that is so well developed and well-known I would expect a lot more.  Now would I recommend my friends to come here?  Probably a Maybe Go if they were dying to try it.  But, if they have never even heard of this place and asked me where to go for a good burger bite around the city?  This place would not be on my list.  Would I ever come back here?  Probably a maybe, but I highly doubt it.  There are plenty of other burger joint gems around so why would I choose to come to a place that leaves me feeling negative and the meal leaves my stomach feeling sick?",0
"Oh, well!.. Where to start? My BF and I were at this place twice: honest to god - NEVER AGAIN! There are more good restaurants in the area and 1000s more in all of NYC! 
Why did we go there twice you would ask?- because first impression was actually good - the day was bright and sunny, to have brunch outdoors on a crisp fall Saturday morning seemed a great idea - so, why not to try this new, so much talked about, and so much anticipated in the area restaurant. So we got there, set at the outside table - ordered virgin Bloody Mary (nicely balanced and spicy!), grapefruit juice, I got eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and my BF got scrambled eggs with cheddar biscuits and gravy. And both dishes were perfect!! Just yum. And our waitress was nice and helpful. Plus they had a live jazz band! Awesome! So, we were happy and knew we gonna come back for more! - For greater experience, for a delicious dinner and cosy atmosphere! Oh, we were wrong!!!! Jeez..!
Let me tell you, tonight we went back for a dinner and had a horrible! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! So we got the table for two of us inside, waiter came to us shortly after, gave us menus and asked if we want anything to drink - of course I got that virgin Bloody Mary (and yes it was good! And spicy). This time we saw the dinner menu first time (definitely not the most creative one - seems like they just got a bunch of different dishes from the menus of other restaurants together) - nothing striking there. Oh well, we ordered anyways and thought we never could go wrong with the ""staples"": mussels, and shrimp ceviche for starters, and lobster bisque for my main with the side of sautéed spinach, and beef short ribs with bourbon au jus for my BF's main. At first, waiter came back and said the ceviche isn't available. Then about 10 min later mussels arrived. Cold. Room temperature cold. With a piece of stale bread. We asked for some more bread (maybe hoping for the fresh one). Guy, who brought us food, - said he'll bring some more. And he never did. And we asked our waiter and he never brought it either. Ok. So to the taste of those mussels - I found it fair. My BF said he found couple of pieces too fishy (now he is actually sick and had to take medicine to calm his stomach ache). Then.. The entries arrived. in the middle of the first course.. His plate first. Couple of minutes later mine. I found it bizarre. They didn't give us even 10 minutes to enjoy our so-so mussels and now, when my BF is sick, I'm actually thinking thank god we didn't finish them!!! No joke! Ok. To the entries - ribs were ok. Not great but ok. To fatty though. My soup (oh boy!) was not really edible. This lobster bisque had so many pieces of shell in it, it seemed like the poor lobster was mashed with the shell together in the broth! If I'll be able post the pics - check it out for the reference ;) and spinach was extremely garlicky, even for me(!) - who loves garlic in everything, except desert of course :)). To be fair, I had to say, that manager came to Us to ask how we are doing. And when she heard from me that soup is inedible and saw all the pieces of shell, she admitted - it was not a soup it supposed to be! And offered to bring me another bowl. But what the sense?? It still would be the same soup! But she never offered to take it of the check or to buy a drink or desert. None. We had to ask our waiter to take it of the bill since I never ate even a half of it. And he wen to the manager and he did take it of the bill. Thanks. He was apologetic about the our dining experience. 
In the conclusion: 2 courses and 2 very unhappy and feeling sick ppl later, I can say: virgin Bloody Mary is good, decor of the place is nice, Comfy sitting, Many TVs for the sport fans. But Jeez! That food!!! Whoever is in that kitchen - he/she has to learn how to cook! And management! -  please, step up the game! Otherwise this place won't last long no matter how many TVs you have!!!",1
"Came here and ordered the porterhouse on a friday night, really looking fwd to quality meat in the city. Didn't eat too much of it the meat looked slightly brown when it's normally pink for medium rare. Started feeling sick around 3am and then realized I had food poisoning and threw up nonstop the next day, had the chills and could not leave my house. I called the restaurant asking if I could speak to the manager, they said he wasn't there would call me back but of course never did!",1
"I tried Schatzie's on a groupon.  Got the cooked chicken with two sides.  

In short - fair to poor.  The sides  were terrible;  cucumber salad, sickeningly sweet  (and $1 extra) and the cole slaw was swimming in mayo - in this day and age, really?  The Roast chicken was not very roasted, with a sweet glaze on top that was not crispy. average to mediocre.

I hope the meats are better.  This cooked chicken with two sides dinner is a must to avoid - go to the chicken place on 85th St which is much better.",0
"Our party of four (parents who winter in southern PRC/HK, me, & my husband with a sharp and super-adventurous palate) were seated quickly. This place is roomy and offers good views of all the food coming and going. And all the food looks great. But two big things: 1) 80% of the dim sum items are severely lacking in flavor. The exceptions are the phung zhao/chicken feet and the char siu sow(sp?), both decent but not great. Everything else we had was bland and under seasoned. The textures are right on the money but who cares when there's no flavor. Oh, wait...2) everything featuring whole shrimp (like har gao & har cheung, STAPLES of any dim sum meal) had a terrible texture AND needed seasoning. The shrimp were tough, mealy, and dense. Over cooked or some weird kitchen shortcut (using pre-cooked shrimp?) or poor quality shrimp or all of the above? I don't know why the shrimp were so tasteless and hard but it ruined the har gao, usually a barometer of a dim sum kitchen's skill.

Oh and also, half the staff we encountered were resentful of any questions/comments and just so sick of life in general they could not be bothered to respond to ""Are any of those fried item still warm/hot?"" or ""More tea, please"" and would simply turn and walk away in the middle of an interaction.  This does not matter to me if the food is good.  Which it is not here.

We were seated with a great view of the ovens and my hawk-eyed dad spied egg custard tarts coming fresh out of the oven and walked straight up there and snagged an order. Such flaky pastry crusts so crisp and hot from the oven surrounding a creamy but completely disappointing and flavorless custard. And this is as fresh and good as you can get an item!

All in all, nothing was inedible but nothing there gives us any reason to return either.",0
"Daniel Boulud is one of my favorite chefs in the world.  I have been to this one in particular before and enjoyed my food however, I went a week ago and shared the Frisee salad with my father which has chicken liver in it and had severe food poisoning from it.  I called to tell them about it a few days later because the doctors thought I had salmonella or E-coli and they could of cared less.  Think twice before you go there again.",1
"I came back last night 10/14/2013. I had the Bufala & the prosciutto & funghi pizzas. Both were tasty but unfortunately I got very sick. I didn't get sick the first time but then I didn't stuff a truck load of pizza down my throat. So, i'm going to try again (it's pretty obvious that I like this place) & pray I don't get sick.",1
"So disappointing.

I went to Grano after eating at their partner restaurant, Taverna di Bacco in the LES. I had high expectations after a good meal over there, but I was severely let down.

We had:
-mozzarella: really salty, took away from the flavor of the cheese itself
-spagetti: bland, uninspiring.
-gnocchi: overcooked, too chewy
-pork cavatelli special: undercooked to the point that the diner got sick

and everything else at the table was just generally uninspiring. add to that the fact that we weren't offered fresh pepper or parmesan cheese with our pastas and I was wholly unimpressed. try their sister restaurant, or if you want to stay in the neighborhood, check out Corsino. you can probably make better pasta at home than what you'll find at Grano.",1
"I ate here on Friday night and got food poisoning.  I know exactly which piece of sushi made me sick, too.  It was a truly awful experience.",1
"I have eaten here for years and always loved it.  A few days back I ordered a large pie with 2 toppings and got really sick from it.  I hadn't eaten anything else that day so I'm sure it was something in that pizza that made me sick.  I threw up for 24 hours.  If it was just me that got sick, I would say that I must have caught bacteria someplace else and it's a coincidence that I got sick the same time I ate their pizza... However, the other TWO people that shared the pizza with me ALSO got sick a BOTH threw up as well.  So we are positive that it was their pizza.  I will never eat here again.  And I hope nobody else that does eat here gets sick from their food.",1
"I remember a time when I stopped liking Xi'an food, and I was not sure why. It was either I thought the proportions were small or that it was not delicious enough. Some thing might have been wrong with me back then, because I am addicted to it now. 

I always order N1, the spicy lamb noodles and it is always so delicious. I come to conclusion that I love my noodles to be thick rather than thin squiggly lines and that is exactly what Xi'an Famous Food provides. I love the amount of spice they add into, it is not too spicy and it is definitely not bland. 

On a really hungry day, I would add a beef bun as an appetizer, $3 and it is amazing. In addition, they have a bunch of cheap drinks in the fridge such as soy milk or tea, which is a great add if you cannot handle your spicyness. 

Xi'an Famous Food is a place I can go to 3-5 times a week and not get sick of it. I am glad they are opening stores everywhere. If only they will open one in my neighborhood, but I do not think that we are cool enough for them yet.",0
"I don't know what happened. We used to have a great time at Extra Fancy. The food and service used to be great. All told my girlfriend and I have eaten here over twenty times. The first ten were perfect. Then the service dropped off. The clam bake (which is the big reason we came there) just got smaller, and smaller, and smaller until it was a joke. Then, mild case of food poisoning. Bout says it all doesn't it. Could have, should have been one of the best places in the neighborhood. Was something fancy, now it's just a bar that I would never eat at.",1
One of my favorite brunch places in the West Village. They have a sick deal where you pay something like $35 for a meal and unlimited cocktails. Hence its super yuppie group of evangelists who swear by the place.,0
"Dirty! Stay Away! Went to the Tribecca Amish Market for about nine years (yes, I am lazy and dumb). I even have an Amish Discount Card. I purchased the potato salad, from the salad bar. Of course found a hair in it, yuck. They are unlcean and won't replace their refrigerators. Stay away from any of the frozen or refrigerated foods. Take a look at the temperature gauges. Sometimes the food is kept at over 50 degrees. It would even make a dog sick. Horrible New Owners (talking to you Joe) purchased Amish Market in February 2013. Multiple Critical NYC Health Department Violations (look it up). I can not recommend anything here. Much better off at the Tribecca Whole Foods Market  down the street at 270 Greenwich.",1
"I love this place! Its very hard to find good authentic Vietnamese restaurants especially a place that serves good pho. The food at Pho Bang is amazing. I bring all my friends here and they love it too. It's super cheap and I love getting the pho, summer rolls and spring rolls. I come here very often and I never get sick of it.",0
"This is one of the most authentic places for Mexican food and tacos. Few years ago, they had a ""sauce and veggie cart"" station where you can get as much green, orange, or red hot sauce as you want, along with some radishes, vegetables, jalapenos with your tacos. They took the cart away. Now, they bring the green and orange habinero hot sauce to you. The sauce gives it away. I've been to Cancun, Mexico 5 times and this place even outshines the food over there. There are many, many taco food carts and taco spots around Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. For $2 and change per soft taco, 2 will fill you. You can purchase the sauce here for $3 quantity equivalent of a coffee cup size. When you sit in the small cafe, you feel like you're back in Mexico. I'm glad they are still around. Supposedly they may not always be A status in NYC, but when you eat out, I usually make sure I don't go to a place rated C. B means that they fell short like a point or 2 on details. Unless you make it yourself, just take what you can get because other countries I've visited, they were not always ""A"" status to my book. But you're in it for the taste, experience, and just don't get sick from eating it that's all.",0
"This dump closed. 

One of their customers died from food poisoning!",0
"came for a visit to see what all the hype was about one word, diarrhea the 'rasta pasta""  with oxtail was watery and stale had me and my friends on the toilet for 2 days painful!! the drinks were watered down the place was cramped slow service and the waiters are ratchet n rough like they got hired straight from jail...waste of money over priced",1
"I Wish i could give zero stars so bad the food was horrid i got raw chicken and the CHILI made me sick It was Gross the taste, the look and over All TERRIBLE... Yes its cheap but  taste Gross..... STAY AWAY IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU..",1
"Ordered a burger one night to my apt when I was having a craving. First off, it was huge. I'm sure that's a plus for many but for me it was just meat-y meat. If I was going for that I would have gotten a steak. Ate part of it then felt really sick. I don't think it was bad meat, or not cooked right or anything, just didn't sit well with me. Super greasy. 
If I ever want a burger again I'll go to bareburger.",1
"For the past few months, I would buy salads and soups and although pricey, taste was good.  However, a few weeks ago, I got my usual $11 salad which contained: chicken, carrots, beets, spinach, egg, balsamic vinegar.... well, 3 hours after I consumed the salad, I was violently ill - nonstop vomiting!  Please keep in mind, this salad was the only thing I ate all day. 

Needless to say, I will never go back there! Disgusting!",1
What a disappointing experience. In NY there are so many good places. Why settle for a overpriced mini sandwich. If you want a much better mediocre sub go to subway. At least there the ingredients are fresh and you can get much more for your money. This place is a joke. No not expensive but pure garbage. Every part of experience  was a disaster. Then came the after effects. One hour after eating I was sick as can be. Either the product or the cook was bad. Please include a barf bag and a roll of toilet paper.,1
"Can't recommend them for delivery anymore. Tasty food, for sure--though don't eat this often or you'll really pack on the pounds. But it's been over an hour since I put in my order (and it's EARLY). When I called to ask about it, I was told it's sitting there at the restaurant waiting for the delivery guy. ""Ten or fifteen minutes."" I pressed, and she admitted, ""I don't know. I'll try."" I asked again, ""Ma'am, are you being honest with me? Is it really only going to be fifteen more minutes?"" And here's her reply: ""I don't like to give times 'cause I don't know."" Then, honey, you shouldn't be in the business of delivering food. Hire more delivery people, or stop offering it. I ordered dinner because I'm too sick to leave my apartment. I'll stick to my reliable locals from now on...

It took 3 phone calls and just shy of 2 hours. Take from that what you will. They did call me to let me know when the delivery man was finally at my building (at the wrong door).",0
"Happy hour on Saturdays from 3-8pm (that's pretty effing sick) 

$5.00 Wine, $4.00 beer and house drinks.
$25.00 hookah that can be filled with Mojito or poison of your choice for $10.00

I wish seating was more comfortable and it was really too loud.  It was also really dark and almost creepy inside. I am glad that I had a good company to talk to and wines flowing for cheap. 

p.s. music started bumping right around 8pm. 

I would go if you are into hookah and cheap happy hour. I just wouldn't go back personally.",0
Service was terrible.  Food made me sick....literally.  Stay Away.,1
I am very excited to have a ice cream/sandwich/coffee shop in the hood. I had a sampling of the coconut ice cream...to die for. I ordered a everything but the kitchen sick sandwich! All vegetarian of sautéed veggies stuffed into French bread...which was absolutely delish!!! The staff was friendly! He was excited for breakfast to start with fresh croissants!! I will be back to try one & their burger!! Happy for the new addition!!!!,0
jamba juice is for the sick! vitamin c woooooo.  nothing taste better when youre sick or even when youre healthy.  they must put crack in it or something cause it is addicting! once you get it once you hooked.  power size it all the way!  orange dream machine when im feeling rich although they dont power size that one.  mango a go go or peach pleasure! im done with strawberries wild.  had that way too much.  anyways friendly staff never a problem with drink orders.  always open when i want that satisfying smoothie.  nothing compares.  maybe yummy yogurt.  well thats healthier.  i prefer the real stuff at jamba juice! love it when theres a bogo deal or 2 dolla sixteen smoothie.  otherewise it gets expensive.  summertime wintertime fall time anytime is jamba time,0
"Nope, don't do it!

Brought a large group here for my birthday and was very sorry I did. Came here on the recommendation of a friend who has since lost his privilege to recommend restaurants.  

Food was ok - but several people from my group reported being very sick after eating there.  Weak.

Service? Unfriendly, rude, arrogant.  I could go on for days.

2 stars because the bathroom was really clean or this would be a one star wonder.",1
"We tried the crispy chicken burger as well as the salmon burger. Although they were both good, I didn't like that the chicken burger didn't come with cheese and that I had to pay extra to get cheese on it. The meals also didn't come with fries, which cost extra. I ordered a coke but was told that they only had diet coke and dr. Pepper. The waiter was nice and offered to go to the next store over and get me one. The negatives for this restaurant include the atmosphere, which isn't anything special, and the fact that one of the waitresses, who was handling the food for other customers, was obviously sick and coughing.",0
"WARNING GUYS SERIOUSLY .....Uh I really want to be able to give them a good review, BUT WARNING: EVERYONE I HAVE SENT THERE AND EVERY TIME I ORDER THEIR PIZZA ...A SERIOUS FOOD POISONING HAPPENS. In all honesty, I have only been able to eat them a handful of times. I feel terrible, my roommates, friends, everyone has gotten sick. Too bad because it's delicious, delicious in the way that you will be miserable for 24 hours after. Try Fornino- or La Nonna- that is traditional Italian pizza, owned by families that have been in the neighborhood for over a decade. You can try it, but 3 times out of 5 you may just get a stomach virus...",1
"I went to the Mekong just to drink a Corona after work the day before yesterday and my stomach started to hurt REALLY BAD right after I finished this huge glass of water they served me before my beer. I'm still struggling with what I think is a real food poisoning thing: stomach ache, cold sweats, nausea.
I didn't try their food so I don't know what it is but DO NOT drink water from this place.",1
"This place is a disaster.  In sum:

-Order took 1.5 hours to deliver 4 blocks 
-Order arrived cold and incorrect
-Soup came (cold) with crackers already in it, giving the sense that it was recycled from a customer that didn't finish
-Grilled cheese (cold) had about 1/2 pound of muenster cheese, was made with some odd marbled bread and definitely microwaved instead of grilled

I almost knew what I was getting into with this place, but I was sick and needed soup.  Needless to say, my sickness was made worse.

This is by far the worst UWS diner and restaurant in general.  A complete and total disaster.  Hey Big Daddy's, shake your tots out of my neighborhood.",0
"Paul Allen: ""This is really a beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. This place is hot, very hot. "" 

I have an idea, I think I'll take a Spanish girl...to....a Spanish restaurant. Seemed like a good idea at the time. 

Note to self: Never make reservations based off of the retards that post on Yelp. You guys are all on drugs...and bad ones. You geniuses wrote these reviews while operating on really awful drugs. Either that, or you've all had your taste buds removed by some twisted German Dr. as part of some sick LSD-fueled experiment. The review below me called it ""a hidden gem"". Yeah, ok, maybe if you just came down from a 3 day crank bender. 

I'd rather do shots of Drano than visit this hell-hole, again. We should have just walked out upon the realization that there was a grand total of 5 people in the entire establishment.....at 7:45....on a Thursday night. The decor in the dining room in the back made me want to upchuck the bad food that I hadn't even eaten yet. The over-illuminated room was about as romantic as the triage at Beth-Israel. Maybe a candle on the table?? No?  So, there's that.

Now on to the food: 

Let me preface this by saying, I'm not a picky dude...at all. I'd make an awful food critic because I generally think everything is good. I have eaten Beefaroni in the last 6 weeks...and I'm 35. Unless we're talking about steak (I'm an effing steak connoisseur), I'm generally going to be satisfied with what I'm eating. 

We ordered several Tapas, and all of them were forgettable, or worse, inedible. The smoke show Spaniard I brought with me abhorred everything that we ordered. This is not a good sign of authentic Spanish cuisine. The calamari was undercooked, as was the shrimp, and the duck/rice plate started off semi-decent, but as it cooled, resembled something that Fern would serve  Wilbur (Yeah that's right, I just made a Charlotte's Web reference). But hey, the wine was good (because it wasn't made by the hack chefs at this dump). 

Definitely check this place if you're looking to spend your hard-earned money on a bunch of crap, in a very lit setting with no people. If not, check out somewhere a bit better....like Taco Bell.",0
"Loud sticky bar with 10 screens blasting football games. (It was a Sunday). 
There was no room to stand downstairs near the bar so we walked upstairs to a ledge next to the control room. 
Yes I like football but I hate unable to converse with people about the game. 
Or converse at all. 
The games are blasting, pop songs are blasting on top of that and half eaten food baskets and half finished dixie cups lie around, filled with Miller or Bud. We ordered a pitcher for $5 (What a deal!) but it tasted like 80% water and 20% swill so I gave up. I would advise you not to drink a Guinness on tap (from another location) and drink Off the Wagon pitchers. Not a great idea. 

This bar made me feel old and crotchety. We got sick of not being able to hear one another, so we all left in search of a better place.",0
"I rarely have bad experiences and don't usually like to write reviews like this but...

Burgers - 2.5 / 5
ranged from a little dry to somewhat moist, nothing remarkable, each one had some bits of cartilage (!) also 

Fries (I had the yuca ones) - 2.5/5
they seemed drier than they should have been

Wait - very excessive - like greater than 20 minutes which is nuts

-- you are better off just walking over to five guys which is faster and better

Also -- I felt sick later in the day which I suspect was from this food - I'm not certain enough to dock a star from them, but I'm certain enough to never even consider trying it again",1
"After searching an website for dog friendly places to eat, me & my little family met a friend at this sweet little cafe.  The sun was shining so it was perfect to grab a seat outside.  The wait was short & there were enough new four legged friend to meet to keep us entertained.  The dog friendly corner fountain is a nice touch.  
I was kind of surprised when I saw the menu as it reminded me of a nice diner from back in my days in Jersey but the prices were a little higher.  I opted for on of their exotic burgers, they serve elk, buffalo & the such.  The burger was nice & juicy but I was disappointed that there were not any options for actual dogs.  A little section would give been nice for a special treat.  Plus there were ingredients in the people food that would make dogs really sick like chocolate, onions, etc.  I am very careful around my dog but if a place bills itself as dog friendly than there shouldn't even be the chance.  I like the concept but a little more care & though has to be out into places like this.",0
"Living in Brooklyn pretty much my entire life and never knew this place existed
My oh my
To begin with, the staff here is very down to earth and hilarious might I add. 
I probably tried half of the flavors before becoming sickeningly confused with what choices to make. I decided to go with their seasonal flavor ""Drunken Pumpkin"" and ""Peppermint Pattie"" can't really remember the name, on a waffle cone. Weird combo but tasty as hell. I'm craving it... right. now.",0
"I have checked in and been here twice and my experiences were different.

The first time I ordered the blackened fish sandwich with garlic mash potatoes. The potatoes had no flavor, so I left them uneaten. The sandwich was good.

I came back a second time to give another item a try. I got the fried oysters and fries. The fries were burnt and the sandwich was not good. I ate half and got sick from it all night. Im so bummed because I like the way this place looks and feels...but the food was such a disaster...I probably wont come back.",1
I don't recommend eating here!  I got ridiculously sick after. Not 100% positive it was because of the food but it is awfully convenient!,1
New chef = butter and oil breakfast. The only thing left that is good here is the Bloody Mary. Sickening brunch.,0
"Thank you Lenny's, you have made this pregnant girl very happy. So glad to know that you have fresh roasted turkey from the oven-not deli meat! I haven't had a turkey sandwich in 7 months and this hit the spot! 

I ordered the turkey roast, provolone on a kaiser. So delish and the bread was soft.  
I have had their tuna sandwiches which are yummy, as well as their soups. I heard they do a thanksgiving turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and it's popular. They pack a large crowd in for lunch. I always say -avoid the empty restaurants! 

They also deliver. 

My only gripe:
****Attn Lenny's employees: 
you need to know whether your cheeses are pasteurized or not. That is a very common question for anyone who is pregnant. I called and asked and no one seemed to know. If a pregnant person eats cheese that is unpasteurized, they can get very very sick. Just FYI on food health and safety.",0
"I have given this place three chances, and have gotten diarrhea each and every time. The food also took over an hour to come even though I am only three blocks away. Taste of a long, painful night. Stay away.",1
"Not even a one star... only place I've ever encountered issues like this.

So we ordered our food about 2 hours ago. Starting at the one hour mark we began calling them to see where our food was. We were told it was out already. After another 15 minutes we called again and were told that they would need to track down the driver. After another 15 minutes we were told that the quoted us incorrectly and that our food had just left and would be here in 5 minutes. After ANOTHER 15 minutes we tried to called back, and have been doing so for at least 10 minutes, but the phone line is busy or just rings and rings. Now we are in limbo because it's almost 10 o'clock, many of our usual delivery places are closed and we don't even know if these people are going to show up so we can't order anything else. Oh wait!! My husband just got them on the phone, said that the food was still not here, asked for a refund and THEY HUNG UP! Anyways, we will need a refund because, at this point, even if the food arrives, it will be cold and we will be in bed. As I am typing - the food showed up. Still super pissed. If you are good with a two hour delivery time and a bunch of chasing your order then have at it.

"I usually go to the one by 30 Roc, but I decided to try this one. Kind of smaller (not by much), but the same great cupcakes and banana pudding. (MUST TRY THE BANANA PUDDING!) Alwys polite and clean. I must say I think bleeker store was more nicer. 
Side note, if you like peanut butter, try their peanut butter blonde. OMFG! it was good. Word to the wise, if you try to eat it all at once, you will get sick. Trust me, pace yourself.",0

Sunday morning breakfast - 10am - took nearly 30 minutes to get food. Restaurant 1/2 full with lots of waitstaff standing around but hard even to get a 2nd cup of coffee. Eggs Benedict - bland. Vegetable frittata so over cooked with tons of marinara sauce and melted cheese - rather sickening plus burnt food in home fries that looked like cock roaches ( I hope) - it wasn't but just added to the unappetizing food and poor service.  Reporting - poor service - they don't seem to care!,0
"My boyfriend and I went here on the recommendation of a box office agent at the theatre where we picked up our show tickets.  We had some high expectations based on this recommendation.
The restaurant itself is very neat, architecturally, though very poorly lite inside.
The staff wasn't the friendliest.  Mostly dead pan stares and a lackluster personality from the hostess.  Our waiter barely waited on us whatsoever. He disappeared for long periods of time.
The pizza itself... well...
We ordered a traditional with prosciutto, spinach and fresh garlic.  The spinach was really wet... likely from a can and not fresh. It didn't taste good either.  The prosciutto was just... NOT prosciutto.  It was thick sliced and tasted like regular old ham.  Underwhelmed is a good word for it.
On top of that, my boyfriend got sick after eating there too.
So, I personally do not recommend this place.",1
This is not the Ollie's that used to be near Times Square. I am not sure how they are using the same name. The environment itself is pleasant and well decorated with friendly staff but the food is far from being pleasant. The scallion pancakes were dripping in oil which is amazing as even over local Chinese restaurant does a better job with them. The dumplings were good but the cumin lamb was almost inedible as it had about 10 times as much cumin as it needed.  We are used to eating all kind of spicy food from all kind of nationalities and we cook all kind of spicy food ourselves plus my background is Indian. Trust me this was bad. The beef and noodle soup was tasteless. So i put one tiny piece of the cumin lamb in the soup and it flavored the entire dish with cumin. At least then I could it eat it. Six hours later we were both really sick. I can't say for sure it came from this meal but even with out that we will never go back to this place.,1
"First off I know Sushi - I'm Asian.  Period.
This is some good sushi - not just for freshness (it has to be fresh otherwise you'll get diarrhea) but more for creativity

Appetizers are ALL good, I'm biased towards the agadashi tofu (my favorite - yum yum yum)

For sushi, I always get the Tuna special dish - $55.  You get a spicy tuna roll and 10 pieces of specially prepared, different taste profile tuna sushi.  This dish is friggin awesome!!!  My only gripe with this dish is one time the waiter was pointing to each piece explaining what it was and his finger was really close to touching each piece - made me a little nervous 

If you want the best sushi experience, go to Sushi of Gari 46 (I know there are other ones but I heard each are a little different and this one i already know is the bomb)

I can't comment on the omakase because I'm not baller-status yet

Oh, and it is kind of annoying that they don't have Japanese Whiskey (like Yamazaki 18).  Diet coke is the beverage of choice here",0
"A friend and I finally made it to Bourbon and Vine on Friday evening for post-work drinks and appetizers. 

1) Loved the ambiance. Friend waited for me at the bar, and had a great time chatting with locals and the wait staff. When I arrived, we moved to seats in the back that were so comfy I could have slept there.

2) Friend had bourbon drinks and was entirely satisfied. I am more of a beer drinker and was pleasantly pleased with their selection of beers, along with the price ($6-$7 for Founders and River Horse).

3) Wait staff attentive and friendly. It was a busy Friday, but we were not made to feel rushed to leave. 

4) I ordered meatball appetizer. Serving size disappointingly small for the high price ($9 - $10 apps). Everything did taste delicious, BUT I GOT FOOD POISONING. Within 3 hours of eating the meatballs, I was 100% ill. Was down and out for the entirety of the weekend. Did not eat or drink anything else that could have given me food poisoning, I am 100% positive it was the meatballs. 

Would not go back to Bourbon and Vine. Great potential, but I cannot eat or drink anywhere that does not store/serve food in a sanitary fashion. There was obviously something wrong with the meatballs - bad meat, bad eggs, I don't know. Disgusted.",1

"I wish I could rate this a Zero!! I went yesterday, October 20th 2013 with my family of 9. The man in the front says oh I'll give you a deal on admission price. it came out to 37 dollars. When I said how is that a deal he said its a good deal I said its simple math... so I just brushed it off and walked away. There was a terrible vendor who served tasteless food and stale bread charged 22 for 2 hamburgers and 2 shishkabobs. Then we began to look for pumpkins.... The pumpkins were all brusied and mot were missing the stem. We finally found 2 ok pumpkins paid more money to buy them and went to find a spot to paint them. When we asked the woman who was giving out the paint where are the brushes, she said u have to find one on the table. We finally found one after 20 minutes and the kids were painting their pumpkins. The 2 minute hayride we waited on line for an hour to get on and the man who was driving it is obviously not all there, he stared everyone down with a nasty look.

"When I turned 30 this year, I realized with a bang that my time on this earth is limited. I don't have time to waste on things I hate: bosses, work, small talk, vegetables. I have to focus what little resources I have on things I love: ice cream, pizza, ramen, ice cream. 

Sundaes and Cones is the best. I have traveled the world and braved obesity, heart disease, food poisoning, ridicule, diabetes, and here in NYC even poverty, to try every ice cream option imaginable so I can come back and bring you the news that, without a doubt, Sundaes and Cones is the best. In the world.

Even as a classicist when it comes to ice cream flavors, I just can't resist the stuff they come up with: Thai Tea?? Lavender?! Come smother my face with this ridiculousness, please.

I don't know how they do it, what kind of dark magic they use, but all the ice cream here have simultaneously the 2 characteristics of: 1) so creamy that all you want to do is swim in a pool of it, but you wouldn't be able to move your limbs due to the thickness and would therefore drown and die (but what a way to die); and 2) intense flavoring that reach out with their little dairy fists and punch you in the face. I went in to try the pumpkin today, and the coconut. I was definitely punched. Ohmigod. Assault me. Assault me good.

Old favorites ( ate last week): black sesame, taro, red bean, ginger
New favorites (ate this week): thai tea, lavender, pistachio almond, coconut, pumpkin

And there is more, guys, THERE IS MORE.",0
"I give this restaurant two stars solely because I surprisingly didn't get food poisoning after this meal. The atmosphere and service were extremely lackluster, which could easily have been overlooked if the food had been even marginally tasty. I went in on a Saturday evening craving some fresh Asian food. After trying the spring rolls, pulled pork sandwich, and chicken/buckwheat salad, each dish gave me the distinct impression that it had been prepared and left out on the counter at least a day ago. The food was neither fresh nor tasty. Not only would I not go again, but I discourage others from trying it and risking their own food poisoning luck.",0
"I'm no oenophile, so I have no idea whether this is actually a good selection. (It looks like there's plenty of wine and liquors to choose from, though!) What I CAN say is that the prices are excellent. There are two other liquor stores in the vicinity and this store generally has better prices than (or comparable to) those two. The guy is Chinese and has a discernible accent, but don't be fooled - he definitely speaks English and can answer your inquiries (albeit brusquely). I got a 750 mL bottle of Opici Marsala wine for $4.99. Sick.",0
"I've eaten here many times and it's been decent, but this Sunday I came for brunch and had an awful experience.  

First, there was a screaming baby (not merely yelling or being occasionally annoying, but repeatedly searing the eardrums of everyone in the front area by screeching at the top of its lungs...for an entire hour) whose mother did nothing to discipline her--why was she not asked to leave?  

Second, two orders at our table of four people were wrong and had to be sent back. 

But worst of all is that the Huevos Banados gave me food poisoning. I am in so much pain right now and I'm missing work. I might have to miss an important business trip, as well.   It is KILLING ME.",1
"Just to cut to the chase here - I went here on a Wednesday and had the Massaman curry with beef.  I ended up with an aggressive bout of food poisoning that wiped me out for the rest of the week.  If that's not enough to put you off this place, continue reading.

I agree with the other reviewers - this place tries really hard to be trendy and club-like.  It's unnecessarily dark, with tacky brightly-colored decor throughout.  It's actually a pretty large restaurant, but, with the way the tiny tables and uncomfortable plastic chairs are set up, you're basically on top of the people sitting next to or around you, and it's really difficult to get up and move around.  It's also very loud - again, they try to play club music and create that type of atmosphere, but it just falls flat.

The service wasn't awful when I was there, but it wasn't very good either.  Our waiter was courteous, but it took a while to get our food and the check, even though it wasn't particularly crowded the night I went.

The food seemed good enough when I started eating it - the curry is flavorful, nicely spicy, a very large portion (though they're pretty skimpy on the rice), and the prices are affordable.  But I started to feel nauseous before I finished even half of it, and then it was all downhill (or, rather, down the toilet) from there.

Needless to say, I will never come back here.  There is much better Thai food at much less obnoxious establishments throughout the city.",1
"SEVERED LATEX GLOVE FOUND IN BREAD!

My coworker came to work and told me this disgusting and shocking story. On October 19, she reserved a table for dinner. It took 15 minutes to get a glass of wine. While my friend was waiting for the food, the place served bread. When my friend started chewing it, but she found it to be a bit ... ""chewy,"" she could not chew it, and clearly something in the bread was not part of the bread. She carefully spit it out and ... lo and behold, she finds 1/3 of a severed latex glove. She almost vomited. She had to go rinse out her mouth and is freaking out that the glove may have been contaminated with any disease.

The wine was on the house, but with such restaurant, there is nothing the management could offer that would make any person want to come to go back.  It was so bad, they had to leave and find another table/restaurant because it was just so sick.

I told my friend, who on Earth would want to go to an overpriced place with 2.5 stars Yelp rating!

BEWARE!",0
"This place is alright I guess.  Our appetizer was good, scallops.  My husbands entree was good, but we paid an eztra 10 dollars for literally two bites of lobster to come in the pasta.  My entree almost made me sick.  I ordered the venison, which was a 34 dollar dish, opretty expensive even for NYC.  I ordered it cooked the way they recommended it, medium rare.  I am pretty open minded about how well done my food is, but this was just gross.  I trimmed off the outer 1/8 of an inch of meat, the only part that seemed edible, and I ate that.  It was cold in the middle.  Anyways, that being said, it wasn't a horrible meal, just be careful if you order this medium rare. In retrospect I could have sent it back to have them throw it back on the grill for a few minutes. But oh well.  Another thing that bugged me was my wine.  I only got MAYBE 2/3 of a pour.  Perhaps if someone else in my party wants desparately to go here, I would return, otherwise NYC has way too many incredible restaurants to waste another 135 dollars.",0
You should pay attention to the flags  raised by just the fact CC is named after an SNL skit meant to parody questionable fast food places.  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich at 7pm and was vomiting by midnight.  Luckily we were no longer on an airplane.  Do not buy food from this place.  They will literally make you sick.  Laugh at the name and move on.  How they are still in business after all the consistent horror story reviews is incomprehensible.,1
"this place was great when it first opened...nice decor...new fresh Japanese food to downtown Brooklyn area...just what we need close to the office....but like most thing....that new car smell has worn off....15 bucks for a bowl of soup....come on....

we ordered take out today for our office....Ganzo still doesn't deliver...but at least they figured out how to serve soup.... in bowls...but it's still do it yourself ...

when I asked the staff about why they were not still delivering they said they would never deliver because they were too small...the place and the well equipped, well staffed glass enclosed kitchen is huge by NY standards....my cousin's a five star chef that cooks hundreds of meals a day out of kitchen the size of a closet.....delivering food can increase your business by 30-40% if not more...

We'll I guess they want to go for quality over quantity and profits....however that wouldn't be the case with today's meal....which brings me to the food.

My office is about 5 minutes from the shop....the add your own broth was cold/warm at best....the ramen noodles were still in the shape of the plastic wrapper they came in and clumped together...and my work colleague's chicken was undercooked.....I'm sure'll be writing a review when he comes down with food poisoning or salmonella....

but why would I write such a bad review.....when I got the bill....58 bucks for 4 bowls of soup...I rounded up to 60 bucks.....the guy who ran my credit card showed the receipt the other wait staff and commented on my 2 buck tip.....yeah 2 buck tip for takeout....no delivery....a poll of the office found not 1 person tips when they pickup.....If I'm going to tip next time when I pick up...it;s not going to be the over-educated waitstaff putting my food in a bag but rather hand the kitchen staff the money directly

oh I forgot the loud Hollywood celebrity I spotted on my way out having a power lunch... think metropolitan or barcelona

will not repeat....",0
"I've never left a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth and the worse part was that my husband also felt the same way.  

The food itself wasn't bad. We had the spicy appetizer and the Monkey Roll along with the Three Style sushi with spicy tuna roll.  Aside from the spicy tuna roll which was definitely fishy, the rest was tasty.  Far cry from the best I've ever hard or even delicious, but sufficient to satisfy our sushi craving if not for the fact that we should NEVER EVER EVER leave a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth.  We were both so horrified that we feared that we had to run across the street to buy a pack of gum to get rid of the flavor and it took a while! I genuinely feared that I would get sick when I get home. 

I will NEVER return to Iron Chef.  Don't be mistaken by the packed house, there are better places nearby, namely the one across the street which is DEAD, but SUSHI is unbelievably fresh.",0
"OK, I see people put this place as 2 $ signs?  Really, the prices are extremely expensive.  The great thing is they deliver anything within a few minutes as long as you hit a $10 minimum.  Great when you are sick or need a few items in a rush 24-7, this is the place.  Ive even hah them bring over a 6 pack of beer.  The stuff if good, but you don't get a selection of certain every day things.  I asked for a bag of dorritos and all they had were 4 styles of fancy chips.  This place is good in select circumstances and glad its in the area.",0
"So we made a bee line to Momofuku Milk Bar to try their infamous cereal milk ice cream. 

Ok, I have to give it to them... the ice cream does taste like leftover cereal milk. How do they do it??! What happens to the cereal?? How ever they do it, it's pretty spot on. 

I had the cereal milk ice cream with the corn flakes crunch. I definitely enjoyed the corn flakes crunch since it brought back memories when I would put corn flakes on my vanilla ice cream when I was younger (Why won't more people do this? It totally makes sense). Anyway, the ice cream was good, but I think it's too rich for my liking. I couldn't finish my ice cream because I started to feel sugar sick trying to eat it. And it was such a mess eating that thing in a little cup with a tiny wooden spoon. Why can't we get bigger spoons? I'd suggest to maybe share one ice cream between two people. 

New York has a knack for really small spots, and this is one of them. They have a counter by the window where you can set your desserts down. I did notice that the people inside didn't really bother to wipe the counter at all and there was some ice cream spillage. They also have benches outside where you can sit and enjoy your dessert. 

It's really a-ok. I'd still suggest it to other to at least try this place once.",0
"Beware! Food Poisoning!!!
My husband and I ordered their seafood dishes and all got food positioning. That's the only meal we have together , so the food poisoning must from this restaurant. Diarrhea, Vomiting and Abdominal pain..gave both of us a miserable night. Will never go again!",1
"Well, if I could give something 0 stars I would.  I hate giving such a bad review, but seeing as how I am writing this from home now, as I food poisoning prevented me from going to work today I think it's justified.

I partially blame myself - 50% off is a wise decision for buying shoes, not for seafood.",1
"WARNING: My husband and I are still recovering from a horrific episode of food poisoning from this place.  Salmonella to be exact.  We were on our way to a family event and needed to grab breakfast on the go. Big mistake.  It must have been the eggs. 

Stay away from this place.",1
"ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do not eat here
i repeat do not eat here
food poisoned and threw up for two days straight. owners are nasty and rude. there are wayyyyy better jamaican restaurants in the area
stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Come ride the vomit comet! Puked for almost a day and a half after eating greasy, nasty, small chicken wings served by a sullen staff. This after waiting close to an hour. AVOID!",1
"I love dub pies!!

They have great location, great service, and great food and drinks. 

I've tried their mince and cheese + shepherd's pie, and it's complete heaven for someone like me who loves savory food. the pies are very flavorful and the pie crust has consistently been baked perfectly.

If you haven't tried their flat white, please do. It's super smooth and the guy who made it for me made a cute leaf design. I told him I shouldn't be drinking espresso because I was sick, but he told me (correctly) that flat whites have a really smooth texture. It also helps that the guy who works there on Wednesday mornings reminds me slightly of Hugh Laurie. 

I'm also super happy with the location. Its right on the way to class as I get out of the subway system. I couldn't be happier!!

you can also pay in advance for a pie or coffee for a friend!! Whee!",0
"4 star review for this place?! You must be kidding, yelp.
Tako yaki was OK, but Okonomi yaki was horrible. It tasted only cabbage and flour, and the texture of dough made me sick.",0
DO NOT EAT HERE. The food made me sick!! I ordered chicken tikka masala and naan. The naan was okay. the chicken tikka masla was terrible. It tasted like the horrible cooking cubes you can buy from the store. I then woke up in the middle of the night sick. Save your money and stomach!,1
"My boyfriend got food poisoning from their chicken fajitas last weekend and it was a horrible nightmare. (We are 100% positive that's what it was from.) He was in agony all night long and I'm not going to even get into the gross details.

But what's equally shocking is that I contacted the restaurant to tell them to check their chicken and they didn't seem to care. I emailed first (it was 4:30 a.m. after all) and got an automatic reply with the promise of a response...but no response, ever. I called later the next day and someone said the manager would get back to me...but he never did.

Seriously? We spent $75 for okay food that made one of us incredibly ill and absolutely no apology or concern from management. STAY AWAY...or order something tame like a grilled cheese, because apparently chicken is too risky at this place.",1
"Was feeling kinda sick so ordered the Kimchii soup.  It was soooo yummy, just perfect - and it totally cleared my sinuses.  It comes with plenty of sides (more kinchii), and also ordered the dumpling sampler which was delish.

Only down side for me was the $20 minimum to order delivery (at least on Seamless).  Not happy, but the food was yummy and looking forward to finishing it tomorrow.",0
"Holy cow this place has a lot of options.  I left feeling super sick (in a good way...I guess).  We ordered a cannoli, cheesecake, carrot cake, and chocolate mousse for the table.  I know, we're really original.

Most of it was good.  Not spectacular, and probably not worth the price.  But due to the history of this place, it's fun to go just once.

My biggest gripe was that you can't order all of the things at the counter if you're getting table service.  So I didn't get to try a lot of the pastries that first drew me into the place (like the red velvet pastry behind the counter.)  So order from the counter instead.",0
"i have gotten sick almost every time i have eaten at bad burger -- not to mention that they are almost always out of what i want & though their pickle chips are delicious, they give you far too few for the price they are asking. go anywhere else.",1
"i like the taste of a lot of the dishes at coco lin. i was a pretty loyal fan for a long time but then it started making me sick. too much oil & grease, maybe. general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, orange chicken -- i am a big fan of the faux chicken, i will just put it that way. their chicken nuggets are great but for wings i'd rather go to foodswings. their french fries are krinkle cut & even taste like they are the frozen ore-ida brand or something, no thank you. i haven't ordered from them in a while because i'm just worried about how my stomach will react...but i miss the taste!",1
Made me sick.  I had to hug the toilet for 24 hours.,1
"The best place on earth!  My favorite food and not expensive.  I once had (3) cheeseburgers in a row, well in 1 sitting, over a few hours.  But still, they all tasted equally great, cause normally by burger 2 & 3 you're like ok maybe getting sick of this, but not this burger.  I cant' say enough.  I've heard people say this burger is better than Shake Shack and I completely agree.  The burger isn't even the best thing on the menu, but I mention it cause i'm addicted.  But you have to have the friend chicken.  It's legendary.  And any specials they put out - catch them while you can cause they rotate that regularly.  BRING BACK THE SHRIMP PO BOY!!! People say the service sucks, but I say it's not too bad.  You have to order at the bar, but I mean the pricing is so cheap, who cares.  I also love the drinks.  The best Pina Colada in town & maybe ask for a safety drink if you go in on a Wednesday.",0
"PLEASE. DON'T. DO IT! I've always been a crazy fan of sushi, going to different restaurants to sample and explore the amazing different rolls of sushi. Never have I sat down at an ""all you can eat"" sushi buffet and spot it empty. I have stepped inside this sushi place twice; once to pick up a menu and once to actually sit down and try their AYCE; both times only had either one customer or none. Worst way to waste 20$ is to go to this place.

Let's start with the positive:
- The place is clean and small; plates are cute and the furniture is decorative.
- Lunch AYCE is 11.99 while Dinner is 16.99. This is a dollar cheaper than Sake (which is pretty much the best known sushi buffet around bensonhurst)
- Menu is not that small; it has the basic rolls and appetizers.
- Appetizers such as the crab rangoon, which is abundant in fillings, and the fried calamari is delish. But the appetizers totally had us fooled about the sushi.

Negatives:
- Bland! Most of these things were very bland. The rolls were not horribly made, but the taste of them! I've never ate a sweet potato roll that was not sweet at all!
- Other appetizers i hated: Dry kani salad, bland chicken tempura, semi-burnt chicken katsu, Lumpy spicy tuna salad (served with a few slices of avocado)
- The best thing about sushi buffet is their unlimited sashimi. Well I could hardly eat it because it was so sluggish and slimy.. I dreaded eating another piece! I felt like I would get some sort of poisoning from this place, but I don't want to be charged for it. The salmon sashimi, especially, was shapeless and poorly cut thin. FYI I ordered about 6 sashimi and flinched at the first one.
- ATMOSPHERE? During the daytime, it is bright. During the nighttime, it is bright. There is no romantic feeling, thus bringing a date here would be foolish. The (one) TV played a chinese acrobatic show that slowed my mood down even more. 
- CUSTOMER SERVICE? Had there been a good waitress, I would perhaps give it a 2/5. Yet the waitress was the only one working in the front with the chef. She hardly says anything, no smiles, no nothing. She and the sushi chef constantly returned to the back to the restaurant, leaving us to feel like the only ones there. (we were technically the only ones there except for another couple). But it made me wonder how long it would take them to realize if someone were to dine-and-ditch. (of course I'd never do it, but their method of running a business is just ridiculous)

LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWS. I ignored that this place has a 2.5 rating; my big mistake and my punishment is a stomachache. I predict this place won't last long at all, and I feel bad to say that about someone's business. Get better staff, workers and redecorate! It's not in a horrible location to begin with. 

P.S. I found a fish scale in my spicy tuna roll. It happens occasionally with other places, but this does not help my first impression.",0
"this place gave me terrible food poisoning! i called to let them know about it, and they were extremely rude and hung up on me. DO NOT EAT HERE.",1
"I used to live about 5 min from here so would order often. Now that i've moved a bit farther, i still called here to order since their sushi is consistent. Never had a problem or gotten sick.

I ordered this week (4 rolls) and for whatever reason, they didn't give me the 3 rolls for $9.95 special (mehs!) and i didnt realize till afterwards...booo to them. The kani salad was good though.

Oh and their rolls? My order was the shrimp tempura roll and shrimp avocado roll. Each piece of the shrimp avocado roll was about the size of a booger. I was left wondering if the rest of it was left back at the restaurant :(",0
"This place was so-so in my book.

Came here on a Tuesday for a friend's going away get together and found the place to be backed with fairly older crowd. Come to find out, there are two groups meeting (Nest Seekers and Citi Habitats), so we got a table in the back, where it was dead.

The server seemed super busy, although, there weren't many tables filled. Luckily, we all had a lot to talk about, so we didn't really mind. 

When our food came, everyone agreed it was 'eh' - however, my friends who ordered the salads, enjoyed them. I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which was definitely not my favorite. We had the Spinach Artichoke Bacon dip as an appetizer, which was super salty. Even the sweet potato fries were not great.

I gave them two stars for the selection of beer. On an October evening, I was super pleased to find that they had a vast selection of pumpkin beers (my fav)!

Want to know the WORST part? As we were paying our bill, our friend noticed a HUGE cockroach on the wall by the bathrooms. Immediately, we all became sick to our stomachs and wanted to get the hell out. Even with an ""A"" rating, we did not feel comfortable here any longer.

I probably wouldn't come back to this place, unless I was going for the booze - and I would stay away from the bathroom.",0
"I went there for lunch.

Had the double cooked pork. Wasn't spicy and tasted OK.

Worst part is I got sick from eating it.",1
"I'm not sure how a $14 bowl of ramen is listed as one of the best ""inexpensive"" eats in New York, but okay... the ramen was decent. The broth was incredibly rich... *almost* too rich but I slurped the whole bowl down anyway! Decent ramen but not the best i've ever had.

Minus a star because my friend got sick (food poisoning, perhaps) afterward. In typical new york fashion, it is crowded and you will almost definitely have to wait to get in.",1
"I paid $11 for 3 rolls. They weren't slimy. They didn't smell like garbage. They didn't make me sick. They didn't taste like cardboard. 

I paid $11 for 3 rolls.",0
Found 3 LONG strands of hair in my guava and cheese pastry! I am sick to my stomach!! Will never go here again..,0
HORRIBLE!!! I feel so sick after eating from this horrible place that did not even get my order half right. Will never go back. Ever.,1
"Roach on the ground.  Ok.  Bug in the water. Ok.

Food was not so good.  Open 24 hours a day.  Good for the club crowd.  So if your drunk you can't taste that the food ain't good.

Cold chicken and bean sauce straight out the Goya can.  Yes, straight out the Goya can.

Not a place to take a girl on a date.  Strictly for people coming out the club.

Also I came in before to get some tostones.  They had none.  Shut the front door.  A Spanish store with out tostones, it's like a beach without water.

I would recommend this to no one cuz I am about to be sick.",0
Nastiest and most expensive rinky dinky Spanish restaurant there is!! Save your money and save your intestines!! After eating their food I got explosive diarrhea for three days!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!,1
"I really wish there were half stars on this because I'd give this place 3.5 stars. Anyway, where to beginnnn...

My friend and I were originally going to another restaurant nearby but didn't have the heart to wait like an hour and thirty to get seated. She spotted this place because of all the Christmas lights and a lightbulb went off in her head -- she heard this place was an amazing experience, so I said why not! At the time, there weren't a lot of people loitering outside, so we walked down the street to this bodega to pick up some beers to share as it's BYOB. Got back and there was a HUGE gathering outside with people on each step of the narrow staircase but luckily one of the guys spotted us and noticed it was just the two of us (we can make it if we try... -- sorry had to) and we squeezed up the tight stairway and was transported into this crazy lighted space. 

Warning. This place is SMALL. like REALLY REALLY SMALL. If you've ever ridden on a yellow school bus when you were primary/secondary school, this space is exactly like the inside of a school bus on steroids. I mean, close quarters and low ceilings, enhanced by the fact that the amazing lights are hung incredibly low. I'm 5'1"" and I felt a few lights on the top of my head.

This place can get incredibly loud, especially when you've got like 4 birthday parties within one meal time session. And each time they play this awesome (for the first couple of times) birthday song with the strobe light effects, but it gets old after about the 4th time. I'm certain the workers are all sick of it by now, haha. 

We ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chana shag (chickpea and spinach) and both dishes were okay. They weren't anything to write home about -- and I have really high standards for Indian dishes ever since I got a taste of real home cooking -- but they were good decent plates, and I had been craving Indian food so it probably tasted even better than it actually was but I digress. Food came out hot and yummy. The naan wasn't bad either, but I've had better vegetable samosas. I think it was just like potato and curry in it and nothing else. The mango ice cream was yummy too. Just a hint of mango and made for a nice ""palate cleanser"" I guess, and it was free, soooo that makes it even better. 

Another thing that we didn't know about, it's a cash only place. So remember to bring cash!

So I give it 3.5 stars for the atmosphere -- the fact that people around us all seemed like they were having an amazing time (probably all the hard liquor we saw at some tables), the trippyness, and the food was okay. It's really something to experience. My friend is already musing about having her birthday dinner here just for the lights and the BYOB.",0
"If I could give zero stars I would. If you are in the mood for a good burger, do not eat here. Weird thing to write considering they are a burger restaurant. But they suck.
  I want to blame this foul taste on the fact that they are organic. But I can't, I have had great organic burgers. The fault is in the fanciness. The mayo has something else in it, the ketchup is typical of organic ketchup, pretty bland and in dire need of sugar and salt. I ordered relish on my burger. What ever the hell that is on it is nowhere near derived from a pickle. Tastes like curry and cumin, I dunno. Just bad. 
  I should have just gone to Paul's da burger joint, but was too lazy to hit an ATM. I regret that decision. And all for the low sum of 48 dollars. One good thing though, they can make a strawberry shake.

Update:30 minutes after eating in suddenly sick getting sicker. Hate the fact that I paid money to feel like this. Never again.",1
"I used to love this place. LOVE. Then as it got trendier, the food got cheaper and less amazing. Then I just liked / tolerated this place. Came for the brunch. Eventually even brunch left a bit to be desired, and with that B on the door, one could only assume it was earned by the dirtiness of those glasses and silverware. (Brown slime on my coffee cup??) Alas, today, I went for brunch because I was dreaming of eggs Benedict.It's 1230, and I am now extremely sick with what I'm guessing is food poisoning. Two stars because I guess, maybe I'm nostalgic.",1
"I'm so sick of places like this that don't even bother to try. 

My friends were catching a bus back to DC right outside of this restaurant, so I joined them for a quick drink and bite to eat. 

The beer list was boring, but they did have a seasonal on tap (Sam Adams Octoberfest) so I got that. We also ordered some pricey apps -- chicken fingers, jalapeno poppers, and sliders. I didn't eat any of the sliders but tried the fingers and poppers. The poppers were incredibly hot, but it was the wrong kind of hot (caliente, not at all picante) and they came with some sad, flavorless white sauce that was probably cream cheese but could've been anything, really. The chicken was okay and was served with honey mustard.

Our server was nice enough, I suppose. The five of us were all given full menus but we had to ask for a second drinks/apps menu, even though they knew that's all we were there for. The ambiance was nonexistent but at least the restaurant and the bathrooms were clean.

Sorry that this review isn't very inspired... but I tend to draw inspiration from delicious and/or interesting food and drink selections.",0
"First off I am a pizza connoisseur.  I sampled pizza throughout Long Island, New Jersey, Manhattan, and mother land Italy herself.

This place is good...real good.  The tomato sauce excellent and the crust is crunchier than captain crunch cereal straight out of the box.  This is the combination to am award winning slice.

My favorites are the margherita and the chicken tomato slice.  Their plain slice is excellent as well.

Their spaghetti with meatballs is decent- they give you a lot of meatballs and toasted bread which is always nice.  I tried some of their sandwiches and paninis as well, each packed with fresh ingredients and meat.

So why only 4 stars if I've been raving about this place?  Two reasons: first, one time after I ate here I got food poisoning and diarhhead my brains out for about 1.5 weeks.  That wasn't good.
Second, their meat portions/ratio is shrinking fast, and you know I love me some meat.

But I still come back...best pizza in Little Neck/Bayside area, hands down",1
"If you want that DAANK burrito/Texas Wrap* (highly suggest the texas wrap with bbq chicken) and you're sick of chipotle ... Texas Rotisserie is where its at. I love the texas wraps and you can optionly add Avocado which is an obvious must. BIG PORTIONS. Real good bbq sauce on their bbq chicken which is actually pulled bbq chicken, which i hadnt had good pulled chicken before i found this place in awhile. Def worth the dine if you're in the mood for soul food or burritos!",0
"On Friday I had the pleasure of trying out the Neapolitan express pizza truck. I received an invitation from Sarah to come and try out their pizza. NYCTalking.com was out to represent y'all! Anyone that knows me knows that I love pizza, I mean I really love pizza. Some websites will ask the question what would be the last meal you would like to eat before you die, my answer is always pizza.

So naturally when Sarah invited me over there was no question that I was going to come and try out this pizza. The short train ride and the brief walk were well worth it. When I arrived, Sarah offered me a drink and she began to tell me about the company. She told me a lot of things, some of which I don't remember, but one of the main items that I do remember is the story behind the tomatoes. Sarah told me that the tomatoes are imported from Italy, she said that they come from a place close to Mount Vesuvius. She was very proud in telling me that the only component in the sauce was these tomatoes. There are no added salt's or other condiments in this sauce. You can really taste the difference I have to say. Sarah was also very excited to tell me about the truck and how it is environmentally safe. In addition to this the boxes that they provide for take-out are also 100% biodegradable, and they provide recycle bins for your convenience.

Enough about that though, let's talk about what we all came to talk about, the pizza. I have to tell you for pizza that was prepared in under 90 seconds, in a specially made 900 degree oven, in a truck, in the middle of a street in Midtown, this was really, really good pizza.

There are two ways that I judge a pizza, the first way that I judge a pizza is whether or not I can taste all of the individual components. While I'm eating the pizza I taste for the sauce, I taste for the cheese, and I taste for the dough. If I can break down each of those components in my mouth as I'm eating it, if I can separate them and tell the difference, then that my friends is good pizza. The other way I can tell whether or not a pizza is good is to determine if eating it gives me a headache. I suffer from high blood pressure and I get migraine headaches. Due to this I cannot eat pizza on a regular basis because it will make me sick. But that doesn't change the fact that pizza is by far my favorite food in the world.

One of my favorite pizza pies comes from a place called Goodfellas LES. All things considered this pie was comparable with my favorite pie. The pizza comes out of the oven very hot so do be careful about burning your mouth. Give it a few moments to cool down and then sink your teeth into the deliciousness that is a Neapolitan express pizza pie.

The truck doesn't come out to the Wall Street area downtown, however if I am ever in the Midtown area or the Meatpacking district when they are around and I see the truck I will stop by for a pie because it was really, really good. I recommend that you guys try out their pizza pie at least once, and then let me know what you think. Personally I was very impressed and I'm actually getting hungry talking about it right now.",0
"My husband, mother & I got sick from a pizza. Food poisoning- I say order somewhere else.",1
"We went there last night and ordered food, I had high hopes for this place as I love curry and it's five minutes from my home. We ordered the chicken curry, garlic nan, the tandoori chicken or whatever they call it, a side salad and a lassai. I ate the chicken curry and the nan. 

I won't lie the food tasted good although the curry was more soupy and very difficult to eat with the nan. 

The reason I am giving 2 stars is because I am 95% sure the food made me sick! The only thing I ate yesterday was a sandwich at lunch and this at around 9:30. At about 2am I woke up with terrible stomach pains and spent about an hour of my life getting the food out of my system. TMI I know. I really do believe it is their food that made me so ill. My fiancé agrees although he had no problems my timing was a perfect indication of food poisoning and the fact that I hardly ate anything all day also helps my case.",1
I got food poisoning when I ate here and the cook is not the same.  Stay away,1
"They gave me food poisoning & charged a lot for it! There are a ton of authentic middle eastern joints- your in NY, run elsewhere",1
"I wish I could give them a negative star. I was excited that finally a Red Robin was in Staten Island, and couldn't
wait to dine there. However, today was the worst dining experience . I arrived, requested a table for two and was given a wait time of 1hr 20mins which I absolutely did not mind. Finally seated ordered food which came out cold; the cheese on my burger looked like the old Staten Island dump; and the sandwich tasted sooo  burned!  Don't ask about the sweet potato fries that was loaded with salt and very cold. I left there feeling sick with my blood pressure ready to explode. I would never ever recommend this S.I restaurant not even to my two dogs. As for the employees, they need plenty of training they are definitely not ready. Don't get me wrong they are well trained on how to be polite and that's the only training they got. As for my waitress, Lauren, she was very sweet. My advice to her is run like hell and find a new job!",0
"A store just for rice pudding? SOLD! The rice grains are bigger than the ones in those Kozy Shack packs and less watery. There are a variety of flavors, with about a handful changing along with the season. I wouldn't recommend just getting a chocolatey one by itself. Chocolate poisoning is a thing you know. I usually pair it up with the original. They let you taste everything and if you hadn't had your fill by then id suggest the biggest you go is the epic (unless you're sharing, which in most cases you wouldn't be, cause hello, its rice pudding). Their hot drinks are not hot, theyre scorching, youve been warned. Star off cause the staff could be a bit friendlier.",0
"If It wasn't for being drunk I would remember that every time I eat there I feel beyond flabby and sickly full.  

The establishment itself is FILTHY!! 

And to top it off the customer service is terrible.  

They don't even give extra marinara sauce!!! Not very NY of them...",0
"Very bad food and service. 
We ordered chicken and pasta and the food came faster than in any fast food restaurant.
The food itself was terrible and we didn't finish our plate as we were scared to be sick.
The waiter was rude.
It's a pity because the restaurant itself is very unique (decoration, live music).
But i will not come back .",0
"The one star is for location. Otherwise it would be zero stars.

I generally avoid this place because it is so overpriced, even by Manhattan standards. Today I ran in because Trader Joe's was out of no fat cottage cheese and I hoped to pick some up on my way home.

I head downstairs, found the cottage cheese. As I was going to check the nutrition info on the back, I noticed the expiration date. October 14th. Today is October 27th. I checked all the other nonfat cottage cheeses, same thing.

I sought out an employee to let them know. I approached the first (and only) person I saw with a ""Food Emporium"" logo on their shirt and said ""Excuse me..."" and was cut off by her saying ""I'M NOT ON THE CLOCK YET"" and walking away, refusing to listen to a word I said. Wow. No other employees within sight except people working the cash registers so I just walked out.

Hopefully if someone eats that cottage cheese get sick and sue Food Emporium out of business.",0
"I'm really sad to not be able to give Taka Taka a better review. The space is nice, the service is excellent, and the menu is interesting/concept is good. Sadly the food is barely mediocre- bland, doesn't taste fresh, not well cooked (for the things that were cooked), and not properly seasoned. Two stars for the food.

Extra star for not making me sick! (I was a little fearful while eating it...)

I will definitely not be returning. (Though I really wish it was better so that I could go back and bring people there!)",0
"I live across Lexington from this place, and have for many years. I think it is the worse pizza I have ever had in my life. 

Fools are deluded by the flat bread and cheap cheese and 5 cent tomato sauce. Eck. 

I have seen more and more tourists and other fools - not native New Yorkers - line up for this junk, so I stupidly thought it might have improved. That was yesterday, and I am still sick as a dog. This dreck sits in your stomach like a mexican quesadilla  - which is really all it is - minus the heat that could help digest it. This is how sick I got the last time I made this mistake.",1
"My husband and I have basically made this place a second home.  The soup dumplings are simply amazing!  We prefer the pork dumplings to the crab & pork dumplings, but both are fantastic!  A word of caution to any first-timers: The soup inside of these dumplings  is very hot!  The way I eat them is to place the dumpling onto my soup spoon, then pierce or carefully bite the top of the dumpling to allow some of the steam to escape.  Then, you can add some of the ginger soy sauce provided for an extra element of flavor.  Make sure you don't just pop the dumpling into your mouth whole otherwise you will scorch yourself!

I also enjoy the crispy dough, the salt soy bean milk, the dumplings in peanut sauce, the spicy beef tripe salad and the crispy noodles.  The staff are friendly and they always remember us and know what we want.  The restaurant has recently expanded, so they have three adjacent seating areas and can accommodate large parties.  They are also open early and close late, so you can go whenever you have a craving for soup dumplings.  

Most important to me, as my friends know, is hygiene.  Their food is clean and I have always left there feeling great (and I am very, very prone to getting sick after a bad meal).  They consistently get ""A"" ratings, which is so refreshing.

It is a shame that they are cash only, but if you walk over a couple of blocks to Main Street, there are maybe 3 banks within close proximity.  

I highly recommend this place for their wonderful dumplings - one of my all-time favorite restaurants!",0
"If I could give zero stars I would. Went for brunch here since my shakshouka craving kicked in. My friend and I ordered the mediteranean platter which came with pita so hard your teeth chipped ! The coffee was disgusting and even the guy next to me was complaining to someone on his mobile about the offensive coffee - my friend and I burst out laughing as we said this is a sign of things to come - bad food and service! 
An hour later with no entrée I decided to investigate only to be told that my order never reached the kitchen. When the order did arrive it was 2 raw eggs in tomato sauce that was a soup of unappetizing ecoli. My friend's salmon benedict was topped by spoilt mayo another food poisoning hazard! The hostess decided to make up for the poor quality and service by serving us some stale chocolate frozen horrid concoction not worth touching because of all the frost bite we saw and the goey snot like substance drizzled around the plate and center.
I would not recommend this place a rip off with poor service and disgusting under cook food!",0
"I order from here at least once a week. Usually the food is 4 stars, but the food I ordered tonight was one of the worst meals I've ever had. 2 stars at best. I had the fried oyster roll (bitter and hardly edible), the Sake roll (cold and gooey), and The seaweed salad (wilted and soggy like it was made yesterday). Maybe they're trying to poison me? Or maybe it was a one off. Either way not sure I'll be ordering from them again soon. Fingers crossed I don't wake up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. Gross.",0
The worst oyster I had in my life!!!! I've never wrote a review on this but I had to!!! I vomited... Literally!!!!!!!  just happened I hope I don't get sick!!!,1
"The coffee here is excellent but the service is abysmal. I am SO sick of the staff making their coffees in whatever order they feel like. I've been trying to enjoy this place, but it's hard when they help everyone who came in after me first.",0
"I would like to say first and foremost that I love the people that work here. The petite Spanish man with the pony tail is fast and friendly and the woman with the hair net and hips- sultry and accurate. However, every time I eat here, about 30 minutes post getting back home I get sick. I'm talking about complete nausea. It's horrible to admit, especially given that I want so much to like everything about this place. And the food actually does taste amazing. But somewhere in between the high fructose sweetness of those frozen margaritas and the vegetable oils used for cooking un organic meats- I am sick every time. I've tried three separate occasions to make it work, but it just won't. They have an amazing groupon offer right now if any one is up for trying it out. Maybe it's just me? I hope so! Two stars: one for the past and one for the future hope of metate authentic!!",1
"DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT FOOD POISONING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My fiance and I both ordered a well-done burger and ended up getting food poisoning 8 hours later. This was the worst pain I've ever felt in my life!!! I was sick for 4 days and missed work and almost ended up in the hospital. The meat was contaminated!!!!!!! I know for a fact that I got food poisoning from here because I vomited a piece of pink meat that my stomach could not digest and I did not eat anything earlier that day.

I spoke to the manager and he didn't give a damn! He offered to give us 2 free burgers on the house. Why the hell would I EVER want to eat another burger here when it got us sick in the first place?!!!!!!! Why the hell would I ever wanna eat there after everything we've been through?!!! I don't care about the money. It's the principle! He didn't even apologize, but instead acted like he didn't give a damn. It's disgusting how these people only want your money!


I WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!! This is for your own safety. Do not eat here! Food poisoning is the worst! The food is not fresh. These people do not care about your safety, they only want your money! They have been reported before. Do your research! 

 I would've rather went to McDonald's and ate fast food than to have had this happen! I spent over $50 here and ended up with the worst pain in my life! If I would've just went to McDonald's and spent $10, I would've been fine. It just goes to show you how these people have no morals or care for their customers. For your own safety, avoid this place and to everyone else who got sick here, make sure you report it to 311 so they can investigate this dirty place!",1
"Walk slow, because you might miss this placing.... I had a coconut fudge ice-cream, which was good. a lot of coconut if you are a coconut person. the real win here is the mocha ice-cream.  It actually tastes like a mocha without being sickly sweet. I would say if you love coffee, and if you love real coffee, then you should come and try the mocha ice-cream.",0
"I gave it two stars because I didn't get sick but my husband did!  I got the turkey burger - all white meat and dry but the fries were good.  My husband got the ""burger heaven"" burger - said it was good but 4 hours later with nothing else to eat -he was horribly vomiting and then up all night with all the problems associated with food poisoning.  This totally ruined my whole trip to NY to celebrate my 50th birthday with friends bc we had to cancel our dinner celebrations.  When I called to tell the manager, at the Lexington and 62nd location, his only comment was we agreed to pay for it on our receipt.....really?

Not impressed.....",1
"Do not eat or patronize this establishment. It is run by anti-semites.
Raed this;
 http://nypost.com/2013/10/28/anti-jewish-jokes-about-nazi-death-gas-nets-man-900k/

Anyone who goes to this restaurant is supporting people who think the Nazi gas chambers are a topic of humor. They are sick and deserve to be out of business.",0
"STAY AWAY.

My boyfriend and I ordered from seamless.com last night. We're new to the neighborhood, recently moved from Bay Ridge and missed good Halal food.

We still do.

Even with the first time discount from seamless of 20% this place wasn't worth it.  The falafel was some of the worst we've ever had (and there wasn't even any white sauce on the sandwich!!)  It was burnt and dry and flavorless. The small side of tahini sauce was brown and watery.

.... and to top it all off, we both woke up this morning with food poisoning.  I've been in and out of the bathroom all morning. 

Despite it being very close by, convenient, and cheap, we will not be back.",1
Honestly I found this place to be pretty sick. saw this place on tv while watching mnf. Place had a lot of diff beers especially ones you can't find Ina regular store or deli. The girls that work there are pretty hot lol overall dope spot would recommend to get your beer from here for a party or whatever,0
"It took me forever to get a decent reservation at this restaurant. This place must be phenomenal for it to be that difficult to eat here. The restaurant is a nice, classy establishment. The service is extremely professional, and the food, while not phenomenal, is good. My lamb looked like it was severely undercooked. I usually get my steaks rare, but I didn't know if eating lamb this rare was safe. I ate it anyway, and it was moist, tender, and quite tasty. That was last night and I'm not sick yet, so yay! Overall a good experience, except at the end of our meal we felt really rushed. They wanted to herd us out quickly to make room for the next guests. The waitstaff was cleaning our table before we were even able to get up and leave. While it was a nice dinner, we probably won't come back.",0
Sorry but really awful. Had shrimp and clams over linguine in red sauce. Shrimp tasted of iodine which means not fresh - so bad I didn't finish afraid I would get sick. My husband had a chicken dish which he just thought okay. Especially overpriced for the quality of the food.,0
"I ate here every single day for three years.  Without a doubt, the meals gave me the super human strength and resilience to sickness and injury that I have today.",0
"Good coffee but not worth the hype. Seriously. Try Ninth Street Espresso (East Village) or Birch (27th & Madison) and tell me coffee there is better than here. 

Did not like the attitude of the barista, maybe he was having a bad day or just sick of making coffee all day. He was talking on the phone, not attentive and the person ahead of me was pissed off.",0
"MEAT, MEAT and moreeeee MEAT! I've been here a bazillion times and everytime I leave here, I'm sick and tired of eating meat (in a good way!) It's usually pretty crowded during dinner time on weekends from 6:30-10pm. After around 10pm, the crowd begins to slowly wobble out from their impending comatose state from all that they've consumed. The open buffet consists of every raw Korean piece of meat you can think of. You can take as much as you want on each trip to the buffet area, which is located smack dab in the middle of the main dining area, and bring it back to your table to grill. They also serve cooked foods, such as dumplings, chicken wings, corn on a cob and various soups and porridge. Lunch is always cheaper than dinner, with dinner coming in at about $30ish/person these days.

A few notes for those who have never dined here. Every 10-15 minutes, a waitress will stop by to change your charred grill and replace it with a new one. In addition, if you have any types of meats that need to be cut up into smaller pieces or sausages that need to be cut open they will handle it for you too when they come by your table. As for advice, the experienced customers will know that you should NOT wear anything you don't want smelling like Korean BBQ for days/weeks, yet I see people who wear their nicest clothing here anyway. 

Sure, you can throw your clothes into the washer/dryer, but for some reason the smell of Korean BBQ haunts you! Days after coming here, I would think that I can smell Korean BBQ on some articles of clothing I didn't even wear there! I also highly recommend not having any plans the rest of the night, like going to a club straight after eating here, unless you're going to head home to scrub yourself down for a good hour. Everytime I come to dine here, I don't wear my nicest clothing anymore. I try to minimize the amount of jewelry too (i.e. don't wear a watch, chain) or you'll be stuck washing it all down afterwards, even your sneakers. With all that said, ENJOY the aromas of Korean BBQ!

P.S. Their Sunkist oranges are the best oranges in the world. They're so sweet and ""citrusy"" so save some room for them at the end!",0
"This review is only for their regular coffee. I can't speak to the fancier drinks. 

Truth be told, I am a coffee snob and a half. This coffee did not impress me at all. I don't really understand what all the fuss is about. Is it because it's a one-location, small business with cool stamps on their cups? 

Worth waiting on line for? NO WAY. 

Overall, I have to say, I am so sick of the lack of decent coffee in Midtown, I am considering purchasing a small coffee maker for my desk at and adding barista to my resume.",0
"DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO FALL VICTIM TO FOOD POISONING!!!!

We ordered the following for dinner (excuse my Konglish):
tang soo yook
jjam ppong -----  POISON
jja jang myun 

This is not my first time here and I never really liked this place because it is not very tasty, but I was craving jja jang myun so I came with a friend anyway. We shared all the dishes, and I had only a small bowl of the jjam ppong which we later found out though hives on my face and my friend being completely food poisoned that it most definitely consisted of seafood gone bad.

Waiter also stuck his thumb in the food while serving.

I'm curious how many people they got sick last night. Seriously, take your money elsewhere. There are PLENTY of good Korean restaurants in the area.",1
"Okay for real the only reason I'm even posting a review is because I had to make an account to review another place for a class.

This place used to be my favorite thing in the city. I was in love, I told every tourist who asked me for directions about it. My Italian suitemate told me it was the closest thing to home she could find. I went so many times all the pasta guys knew me. I used to go when I was having a bad day just so the pasta could cheer me up. I went so many times I had a favorite pasta chef, Antoine. He is incredible. I don't know if you could taste the love your mom put into the hot chocolate she made when you were sick, but Antoine had a way of putting that same love into his dishes. He took pride in his work and always gave me extra tomatoes and basil :). 

Anyways, I went on a trip to London for a month, I came back and the first place I wanted to go was Vapiano to visit Antoine to temporarily cure me from the pain of the sh*t show my trip was. To my horror, he wasn't there. Whatever. I ask the guy making my pasta what day Antoine would be back and he had no idea who I was talking about. This was impossible, everyone knew him. A bus boy told me there was a fight with management and Antoine and 6 others had quit. My heart broke into a million pieces. Every time I have gone back since (this happened a year ago) it's been disappointing. No one cares anymore. They burn the sauce and put like a leaf of basil and one little cherry tomato. All I want is Antoine's cooking. I wish I knew where he went :(",0
"Well I was really looking forward to ordering from this spot. I love indian food and I can eat enough naan bread to feed a small country lol. However I was very disappointed in how unappealing the food was. I ordered about $32 worth of food and was eager when it was delivered. The lamb tandoori was disgusting and the seafood curry was runny with teeny tiny pieces of seafood. It was bland and so tasteless that I couldn't even force myself to eat it ( yea I was gonna try to make myself eat it cause I spent $32 on it)!!  So I ate my bread, rice and French fries thinking ok so it wasn't a total waste of money.  WRONG!!! About 5 hours later I had a sever cause of FOOD POISONING!!! I was up all night vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and sever stomach pain.... I thought I was dying!!! I don't know what it was from this place that was contaminated but it really fucked my whole body up!! I think I must have called GODS name about a million times begging for mercy/healing!!! I will NEVER eat here again!!!!!!",1
"Aesthetically, I love it even more than the original Tao (uptown). Stadium seating gets me hot & bothered. Long, dark entrance-way is sick. Hostesses and waitresses are hot. Food was obviously expensive but worth it. I loved the mapo tofu noodles, which was authentic yet original. Bok Choy was even better than 5-star Asian-prepared. Great drinks, especially the Tao-tini. The atmosphere is unbeatable. It's busy but not crowded, even though there is a wait to be seated. Definitely make reservations in advance. The place is huge. It feels even bigger than the one uptown. The bar is in the back and much more secluded, which would make waiting much more endurable. The location is amazing, right in the heart of meatpacking. TAO has done it again. Would really love to come back here on a date.",0
"Most of you will probably be as shocked as the employees of Bud's were today when they found out we had closed. Most of the original Bud's employees were gone before today, they had known that the end was near and was sick of what Bud's was becoming. The truth is Bud's wasn't paying their bills, we had mountains of past due notices from Con Ed, our cable provider, our beer distributors, and our food providers, and on top of that had to deal with poor management decisions. You probably won't get that version in your local paper, nor will be status remain up that long if they're checking. However we would like you all to know that for some of us Bud's was second home, some of us formed hopefully life-long friends, and we all loved Bud's as much as some of you did at the beginning but realized that the path it was going down wasn't our exactly what we wanted to be apart of. We apologize for the obnoxiously loud club music that blasted in your ears while you all tried to eat your dinner and watch your game. We also apologize for the underage teenagers who came in the last weeks and ruined your Bud's experience entirely. We appreciate those of you who stuck by and came in to give us multiple chances or would simply come back just to see a familiar face and grab a drink with us. We turned trashy & believe me we know it.

For those of you who miss your regular favorite bartenders and servers they can found close to home at really awesome bars!! Make sure you check out these bars: The new bar Snowdonia on 34-55 32nd street! Ovelia's 34-01 30th Ave! Bistro 33 on Ditmars and 21st AND for those of you who aren't afraid of traveling into Manhattan! Iron bar & Grill 713 8th Avenue! And opening up next week Bottomzup & grill 344 3rd ave!!

Thanks to everyone who always tipped us appropriately and made our days & nights worth while! As for the rest of you, if you can't afford to tip then stay home!!!

We all really did try to be everyone's friend at Bud's! :)",0
"Asked for a black coffee, sweet. They gave me a coffee with milk or cream. I walked back two blocks to get another cup. Told them they screwed up my coffee, and the lady asked, ""did you finish it""? To which I replied, ""no I threw it out, I can't drink milk or cream it'll make me sick"". They charged me for another cup, and didn't even apologize.

And on another note...the place is rather small. The have two tables in the back that seats four. Up by the front window is a counter that wraps around the front area so you can stand and eat or drink.

Thanks for the lousy service, and taking my money.",0
"Coconut rice - buttery and good (was a challenge to order, lol. English is not the first language spoken by the waiters, I was brought Coca Cola, but we smoothed things out).

Fragrant Spicy Chicken: lemon grass kaffir lime, galangal, flower, onion, served in homemade chef's special blended red sauce - tasty and a bit sickening like General Tso's chicken, but tastier. Something about fried chicken in a marinade makes my stomach not happy, especially a whole order. I would prefer this to General Tso's. No rice was served with the dish.

Roti Canai - on point! little oily, but tasty.

Rojak: assorted fruits and vegetables salad tossed with homemade shrimp paste topped w/ grated peanut & crispy shrimp crackers.
My friend saw this at another table and asked the folks about it, they said it was sweet and tasty. I took one bite and I was hooked on being sick, yeah it wasn't for me. The sauce is thick and black, and my friend ate it all by himself... He said he wouldn't get it again. If you want to get it share it!

Personally a C health rating would keep me out of a spot, but it was tasty, I wouldn't run back though.",0
"Hands down 

Worst meal ever... horrendous service, extremely bland.  My waiter -- if that's what you want to call him -- openly jeered me. It was actually just plain bizarre. Saw multiple roaches at the side windows .

Do yourself a favor and get some street meat instead -- I ended up getting pretty sick after to boot

Here's an update -- the manager sent a message to my girlfriend regarding our last visit.

In it, he attacked her appearance (personally, I'm a bit incredulous as to that -- cuz I think she's pretty fine... Then again, I'm biased :P) and personally attacked her ""class"" saying she was not fit to even dine in a fine establishment like Barawine and that we're not their ""target audience""... Not quite sure what a target audience has to do with showing basic respect... But anyways...

I could get on my soap box and start running down our resumes but what's the pt? This individual doesn't deserve that much of my attention span...

I want to direct the remainder of this msg to folks considering or continuing to show patronage to Barawine.

Bottom line - I haven't received a message this baseless or endured a series of treatments at an establishment this, borderline xenophobic since my days out and about in Boston while I was at Harvard -- I've actually never been made to feel any less than human anywhere else in NYC

People, THIS is what you can expect to receive at this place. THIS is the type of individual they have at the top in general management of the business... Now I'm not sure what in my appearance or general demeanor screamed to this individual that I was not worthy of common courtesy (perhaps I was missing a stay in my collar or the Windsor knot of my tie was unappealing ... Geez I hope it's just that and not something uglier and more hateful), but I do know customers should not be treated like this simply because they're not a fan of the service received (in my defense though I did get sick from the food and did have a waiter who was doing his damnedest to insult me in front of my significant other...)

Do yourself a favor and enjoy one of the many wine bars elsewhere on the upper west side or grab a glass at any number of the establishments on restaurant row in Harlem.",0
"This place is as good as they say... but be warned: If you get a later time slot, the food and ingredients (especially the pre-prepared portions) have been sitting for a few hours. You can see them pull them out of ramekins, pantries, and refrigerators already prepped, waiting to be delicately sauteed and adorned with delicious sauces. Still (and this especially applies to seafood), you have to sort of wonder how fresh it is... #2... like all tasting/Omakase menus, if you're a health- and body-conscious person, this place will make you uncomfortably full. I mean, you feel bad about not eating the world-class food... especially since the chefs are right in front of your face, which, admittedly is part of the experience, but, as with sitting in the front row at a comedy performance, you feel bad if you're not laughing at their jokes (aka gavage-ing their food and smiling about it even though you're several courses in)... #3... be prepared for the explosive diarrhea that will surely follow your experience. Seriously. The only other place that ranks worse than this in terms of the hours that followed was Le Cirque.",1
"I like this place.  They have really good cocktails and outdoor seating.  I love their frozen mojito.  The patatas bravas are great.  The potatoes are small and sauce is flavorful.  I really like the paella de campo (forget exact name) which is paella with chorizo and chicken.  Definitely a good restaurant. 

Oh, and I'm gluten free because of Celiac Disease and I've never gotten sick there.  The chef can do gluten free dishes.  And, I get very very sick if I get the smallest amount of gluten, so it passed my test.",0
"Seeing as I don't trust Gristedes with any of my seafood selections, I decided to give La Rosa a shot and save myself food poisoning and a subway ride. I've been to La Rosa before for little things and aside from the claustrophobia-inducing floor plan, the employees are friendly and helpful. 

I bought a pound and a half of cooked shrimp even though I was put off a bit by the overly fishy smell of the seafood counter. Yes, I know it's a fish department. No, it's not supposed to be blatantly noticeable and the line of good and bad is fairly obvious to me. When I got home I rinsed them just to be safe and although they were fine, many were sloppily cleaned. I felt like David Spade in Tommy Boy -""Uggh, do you always have to de-turd these things?""

I used a little more than half and refrigerated the rest. Sure enough, the next day they'd about all gone home to Jesus and I wasn't going to push my luck. Shrimp should really keep for longer than that. Maybe I caught La Rosa on an off day and I'll still go for other things and leave the seafood to the fish market. They are cheaper than Gristedes and others on some items and the produce is quality so La Rosa is still OK by me.",0
"Got take out here on the way home tonight and lets just say I would NEVER go back.
I ordered chicken Pad Thai and while I was waiting the tiny glimpse of the kitchen I got was more reminiscent of a cheap Chinese restaurant. I kinda felt at that time that I had made a mistake.
When I got it home I found overcooked greasy noodles with a fishy taste. No spice no flavor just a nasty greasy fishy taste with occasional overpowering hot lemon from the lemon slice that was tossed in there.
I honestly had to stop eating it as I began to feel sick.
I have to say that the take out chicken and Thai Noodles I bought for $3.99 in Trader Joes the night before was FAR superior......and that should NOT be the case!",0
"One of the worst chinese experiences ever.  Chin Chin is old, dusted and depressing. The worst is the delivery guys coming down from their motorbikes and walking through the main hall all night long. 
   The food wasn't that bad. The shrimps Szechuan were salty but ok, the citrus sautéed meat nothing special. The $78 pinot noir was light, it was better to ask a bottle for two than the expensive wine glasses.  
  I've just been criticized that my reviews are hard. Well, i just tell my own experience in the restaurants. I travel around the world and i am a total foodie. I spend half of my time in New York, I live here, and i'm mexican. If someone gets offended by my reviews, whatever. A guy told me to come back to Mexico and eat tacos and tortillas. Well dude, try better the next time. 
   Lots of reviews are written according to the prices and not the quality. New York, as all the big cities, have a lot of mediocre and expensive places.
   I just wanted to get out of Chin Chin. This was a successful business twenty plus years ago, but now is facing its imminent death. The good side is that i'm not sick today. Sad, sad. This place is dying, dying, dying...",0
"I WANTED to love this place.  Their delivery is fast, (don't go for sit down service as it's terribly slow), they have big salads, and they're super close to a business I own in NoLita.  Unfortunately there always seems to be a problem- and the food quality and portions are totally inconsistent.  I could easily give 15-20 examples of times Ive been disappointed -but will stop at 3.
1.  When they got my chopped salad order wrong the 3rd time in a row I called and complained. After  waiting 10 minutes to speak with a manager I finally spoke to a lovely man who promised my next salad was ""on him"".  When I tried to redeem this 2 days later, giving his name, no one seemed to know what I was talking about.
2.  One of my colleagues is absolutely positive that she got mild food poisoning after eating a simple chicken breast.  I witnessed (Warning, pushing gross) her multiple and unfortunate trips to the restroom.  We're sure we're right about this because it's happened more than once. 
3.  2 weeks ago, we made a very simple order.  It was incorrect, and we were accidentally charged $20 extra.  It was a busy day at our hair salon, and an assistant paid cash not knowing there was a mistake with the order. Less than 20 minutes later, when I opened my lunch, we called Spring Street Natural, told them what happened, asked for a replacement order and the refund due...  We waited on hold for over twenty minutes only to be transferred to different people and then told that they had switched to the afternoon staff, and our ""account"" would be credited.  In the meantime, We were getting HANGRY!!!  Given my previous experience with them offering credit, I didn't find this solution promising. After speaking to multiple people and explaining that we just needed our $20 back, they suggested for us to call back the next day. We did- to no avail. Our receptionist had to walk to the restaurant to retrieve the $20 for us that following day.

So, after considerably overpaying for not chopped chopped salads, dealing with consistently rude and apathetic service staff, and actually having to pay someone who works for me to walk to the restaurant and  pick up my $20, I've had it.  I feel terrible for their delivery guys, who must get abused by unhappy customers daily, (please always tip them well)!


The reason I gave them two stars instead of one is because every once in a while, the food was excellent.  Now that I've discovered ""Just Salad""  on Seamless we won't be ordering from Spring Street again.  Whew!",1
"Not sure why I ate here again, but decided to grab an egg sandwich. Felt sick shortly thereafter, had a bad stomach bug for the 48 hours that followed. I would not recommend this deli (to anyone).",1
"I had an upsetting experience here a week ago and have been debating writing a review ever since. My boyfriend and I have gone here regularly (almost once a week for dinner) for the past two and a half years. We enjoyed our meals and conversations with the staff. Because of that, I wanted to write off our most recent meal there, and maybe not go back, but also not say anything. However, my boyfriend got sick from his meal, and seeing that reviewer Christine G. posted on 9/29/13 about a similar experience, I figured it was time to share. 

As I mentioned, we usually go for dinner. We have tried a number of the dishes (rolls, udon, tempura, really most of the menu), but one of us almost always ends up ordering the chirashi. Last week, we went for lunch and both ordered the chirashi lunch special, which we had also had before. Our soups and salads were fine. Then the chirashi came out. It was definitely not fine. Some of the fish was okay - the tuna, however, was brown, wrinkled and tough, and the tamago (sweet egg) was also brown. It was obviously not only not fresh, but old enough that it should not have been served. We left those pieces on our plates and when our waitress cleared the table, she asked why we didn't eat them. My boyfriend paused for a moment and then told her it was because they were clearly old. She told us that she was going to tell the chef and manager but did not apologize or say anything else. We gave her our card to pay, and shortly after signing for the first check, they brought back a second because they had left a drink off of the initial bill. We paid for that too, all without complaint, and when our card was run for the second bill, the manager (instead of the waitress) brought it back and basically dropped it on the table without saying a word or looking at us. To compare - on our way in, he shook my boyfriend's hand, patted him on the back and walked us to a table. During previous visits, we have had 20 minute long conversations with multiple staff members, many of whom made it a point to stop by our table whenever we visited, even if we weren't seated in their area. On our walk out of the restaurant, after setting aside the old items on our plates and not causing a scene, complaining loudly, asking for a refund, or anything, some of the same employees gave us dirty looks or ignored us.

For that that amount of rudeness, maybe we should have made a huge stink about it. To top it off, my boyfriend spent the entire night sick to his stomach. We will absolutely not be back.",1
"As natural as they claim to be, their food made me sick. I never posted an update but here it is.",1
"Clemen's is a gift from the late night taco gods, and it's flashing sombrero is a beacon of hope for all those in search of the tastiest tacos!  I am aware that they serve food during the daylight hours as well, however, I have never dined here before sunset.  This is not to say that I am any sort of vampire; I simply have yet to be in the vicinity of Clemen's before dark.  However, no trip to the area is complete without a visit to this tortilla filled Valhalla!

All of their food is excellent and flavorful, and appears to be fresh as well.  I have eaten here at all hours of the night, and have never once been sick, unlike those other establishments that can make your post-taco toilet experience rather nightmarish.  My three favorite things in life are tacos, bikes, and the written word, but I was forced to choose a fourth, it would surely be pleasant poops.  Clemen's has provided me two of those four things, and for that, I am endlessly thankful.

It's also a rather relaxed environment, and often, after a night of drinking, I will come here to write while consuming vast amounts of tacos.  In addition to their amazing meats, they have some of the most delicious jalapenos I have ever tasted, and I will sometimes order nothing more than a large jar of those to snack on, slowly devouring their spicy goodness as I write.  Their staff is also quite respectful, and have treated my inebriated self with as much respect as they have whilst I was sober.  I love them, and were I woman I would gladly throw myself at their feet and beg them to make me their burrito queen by way of marriage.  I would gladly marry their jalapenos as well, however, I believe this country has yet to legalize marriages between man and condiment.  

Finally, know that my one star deduction is due only to their somewhat high prices.  To all you people complaining about styrofoam plates and plastic dining ware, I would like to invite you to kindly remove your heads from your posteriors.  I am a highly respected author, and their accommodations are more than suited to handle my needs!  Take a moment to think of all the places like Yummy Taco, where your food is served in a school cafeteria style lunch tray, or the trucks that send you off with little more than a few napkins and some salsa verde.  Perhaps you should just be thankful they even have plates and forks?  Furthermore, if you are unable to look past the fact that your burrito has not been served to you on the finest of chinas, than you are probably unworthy of such a glorious burrito (or taco, enchilada, tostada, etc), and if I see you people in the street I shall spit in your faces for disrespecting such a fine establishment!",0
"Horrible food. 

My co-workers and I ordered from this spot today and it was just disgusting. The herbed fries that came with my burger were cold and flavorless. The herbs on the fries were obviously not incorporated in the batter and it was just a bunch of spices thrown on top of fries. The bun on the burger was soggy and fell apart when I bit into it. The meat tasted bland. Aside from that, my co-worker ordered chicken pot pie, and it came in the form of a soup (which was the filling) in a separate container, with the crust that came completely separately. When we called to complain, the customer service was unaccommodating - very rude. 

I wish I can just rate it as negative stars, because now I feel sick and want to throw up. Ugh.",0
"I tried ""the Duet noodle"",which
You can choose 2toppings amongst 5or 6
Options.

I chose shrimp wonton and pork hog.
And the volume was pretty big.

Since they don't use MSG,I did not
feel sick when I finished it.

The price was $7.75+tax.",0
"By far one of the worst places for Chinese food. I have an iron stomach (never had food poisoning in my life), so the fact that I had a bad stomach ache after this is a sign. 

General Tsao chicken was SWIMMING in grease, and the chicken was very poor quality. Greasy and soggy. It wasn't crispy. Dumplings tasted old and like they weren't cooked all the way. I don't even know where these dumplings came from but they were just... not good. Especially the veggie and chicken ones. The pork ones were palatable. The fortune cookie was flat out STALE.

The only decent items were the brown rice and plain salad. Hard to mess those up?

Will say that the dinner deal is a good deal though-- for around $11 plus tax you get an entree, rice, soup, and a salad.

Maybe it was just an off night?",0
"I had a great experience with max.  I have been home sick and wasn't able to physically leave the apt to get what I needed from the grocery store.  I stumbled across max when looking for same day delivery in NYC.  I ordered by 10:40am and received my order in an hour and a half.  Insane!  Few things to note, they don't deliver above 34th st on the west side and 26th on the east side.  Their website gave me issues the first time I tried to order and it took me a bit to place the order since I had to restart my iPad.  But once all of that was done, I was thrilled.  I don't know what I would have done without them!  I was surprised how hard it is to find same day online delivery in the city.",0
Entire group got food poisoning. Had a walking ghost tour after and the entire group had to leave in the middle of it because they were vomiting.,1
"I wanted to enjoy this place because I've read so many great things about it on here, but I was simply not impressed. I feel like Red Rooster is one of those Harlem places people go just to say they went because of the name. The cornbread was the best part of my meal. I ordered the yard bird and it caused me to be sick later on that evening.. not cool. My dinner companion had the Mac and Greens. It's a great idea in theory, however the greens were bitter, making the dish not so great in taste. 

Good luck!",1
"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL. Went late on a Friday, 4 of us, for 3 drinks and 1 coffee with dessert. My dessert was NOT a ""homemade slice of cake"" as listed. One of those mass produced, rectangular shaped layered NYC desserts that everyone has. One friend ordered a glass of red wine, that was obviously old and had turned to vinegar. One friend ordered a cocktail that literally made her sick after 3-4 sips. We weren't given a last call or heads up that they were closing, so when she asked for some ginger ale to settle her stomach, we were told they had closed their soda fountain. Waitress brought her a Pellagrino instead and then proceeded to charge her $7 for it. Asked to speak to the manager (who refused to come to the table) but sent the bill back with a $3 discount, with no mention of a discount for the $18 NASTY cocktail that made her sick. Having spent 20+ years in the restaurant business as a manager and a server I was VERY disappointed especially since I was the one who had chosen this spot. Server was nice, but nothing to make me ever go back or recommend it to anyone. But what do I know, maybe they are so well off they can afford to lose business. Good luck to you, Sugar and Plumm! You're gonna need it!",0
"sad.
i really want to love this place more. the aesthetic is great. the location is great.
i brought family here and notified the food allergy. they served the allergen. 
we bring it up. they don't apologize, they just remove it and pour it into another bowl.
family member got sick.
this place sucks.
nice try, no soul.
i've been here numerous times and it keeps getting worse!",0
"The food is all right. I order a lot of omelets from here since they have a good selection. I'm a little frustrated with Coral though; I always request no home fries or French fries with my omelets. The frying oil upsets my stomach and when they package it all together even eating just the omelet will make me sick. However they NEVER follow my instructions to not include the home fries!  I'm happy to pay the same price, I don't know why they can't just not include all the fried stuff. It's pretty frustrating, especially when there are so few dining options in this area. 

Coral, please stop ignoring the ""special instructions"" box on Seamless!  It makes me think you don't give a damn about your customers!",0
"I normally eat at this place after a long days work...Thursday of this week infact was one of those nights. I tend to order the stew or jerk chicken but was craving fried chicken for some reason... Now why n the world would I want fried chicken from a Caribbean place u may ask.. I have no clue. Anyhow It took a little long for them to prepare which is not the norm with this place. The owner is very nice and moves pretty fast. This one instance I got food poisoning an have been out of commission for the last 3 days..just a heads  up 


Stick to what you know",1
Food poisoning from consuming raw fish and chips tonight. Grossed out and sick. Never again this place has gone way down the hill since the last visit many months ago.,1
"Wait time for a Friday night at 10 was only 20 min and the hostesses were helpful...then it goes downhill from there.

30 mins from when we sat until they took our order, and they weren't overly busy. 

Ordered the duck lettuce wraps for an app - the food came out quickly and had a nice presentation but we took one bite, looked at each other and spit it out. The duck tasted diseased - it was truly awful / one of the worst things I've ever tasted. So after hailing down a server for 20 mins, we had it taken away. 

Next was massaman curry - which was alright but nothing you'd order again. 

Was excited to try Spice but it was a disaster. On the positive side, we're both feeling lucky to have escaped food poisoning.",0
"I so wanted to love marble. It's hard to find a great steakhouse in New York anymore. Coming from Chicago I suppose my standards are high, but even for New York marble is at the bottom. The only reason for two stars is because it's very pretty. Has a great atmosphere. Although the night I was there they were taking photographs and kept changing the lighting which was slightly annoying during a Saturday evening dinner. As for the food-- we started with the fried oysters. In edible. Literally. I took one bite and instantly got sick I had to spit it out. Which I can safely say was a complete first for me. I'm really not picky so to spit something out meant it was baaaaad. Then I ordered a filet mignon med rare. Nice couldn't wait. So the appetizer was Awful- maybe their steak will be good- that is what they're supposed to be good at right? Uh no. So first I got a strip steak instead of the filet I ordered. Then I start to cut into it because after waiting ten minutes the waiter didnt come back. So 30% of it was fat and the other 70% was well done. Awesome- I'm officially done with marble at this point. But ok, ill try the Mac and cheese because the picture on yelp looked awesome so at the least this has to be good right? Wrong. It was super grainy. I think they use egg in their recipe (largely a Southern thing), which can be good- but in this case left the cheese sauce broken and gross. If it wasn't egg-- then possibly milk that went bad? Either way, not good. So I ask my date are you doing any better? Unfortunately, no. His steak and fries were eh and also cooked improperly. So sad- looked so promising. Worst part is on the way out someone (who I suspected was the chef -- came from the kitchen)... Asked us how our meal was. My date felt bad and said ""great, thanks""... Fast forward to me writing a yelp review because I think after such a disastrous meal- the owners/chef deserve to know the truth- without knowing where your faults are you can't improve... Even if they did I doubt id ever go back. Sorry marble- your authentic steakhouse feel is not enough to survive.",0
The best Brunch! We walked into this place and fell in love! Bottomless mimosas! The menu is sick and the service is impeccable! The prices are also great! Totally worth it and I will return!,0
"The raw oysters I had here tonight were surprisingly tasty. I hope I don't get food poisoning but for the most part I seem to be doing alright. Sushi here got a lot better. You can tell the raw fish here is fresh. Although not the best options when it comes to sushi rolls but it serves the purpose for hungry people. The cheesecake I had was delicious as well as the banana pudding. Omg the banana pudding was moneyyy. I would go back just for some, for real. They even have crawfish here which I definitely tried for the first time. I loved it. It had a cajun spice to it.

Anywho for $20, I feel like my money was well spent. The oysters I had, crawfish, cheesecake, chicken herbal soup, BANANA PUDDING. It definitely changed my view of this place. I wouldn't mind coming back soon.",0
"Disgusting. Avoid at all costs! I just paid $11 for raw meat and the lowest quality sweet potato fries you can find. Check my picture of the burger. And I wasn't even asked how I wanted it cooked. I just hope I don't end up with food poisoning or e-coli or something.

I went up to order and asked for the Brooklyn Au Poivre and the woman kept asking if I wanted chicken for some odd reason. More than once... I had a feeling my burger experience was gonna follow that same low IQ pattern but I went ahead and paid anyway. No question some of the worst stuff I've eaten in my life. My mistake for not consulting yelp first :(",0
"Nevermind....false alarm!!  I got a stomach ache the other night
the same day I ate here, but it turned out the ache was caused by 
dinner I'd ordered delivered from some local Chinese restaurant,
and mind you, it was a healthy vegan tofu kung pao type dish!!!!
Oh did I feel sick. But anyway, I ate at the New Hyde Park Diner
yet again today for lunch (October 7th) and it was fine!!  Never felt
sick after eating here and doubt I ever will.  I have no issues with
this diner, always get a booth, they have jukeboxes, and it's clean,
service is attentive, food solid, I have no complaints. And that's my 
final word on the NHP Diner.  Others may have had issues here, but
not me.  Definitely one of the better (and few are around here) old
school diners in the entire area.  And it's decidedly better than 
that diner over in Bellerose on Jericho Turnpike, even though that
one is ok, too.  I think this one is better for sure.",0
"Alright, it was very tasty, and the owners were nice.  But I got a mild case of food poisoning and had to run home about an hour after eating there.  To be fair, it could have been my unaccustomed stomach.  Would probably go back for the curry :)

Also, pretty sure it's primarily Pakistani food.",1
"WARNING:  This place can be pretty rough if you have any stomach issues.

So I wrote a review right after getting home from this place.  Unfortunately, my review has to change.  I was feeling full when I got home after eating here, and it only got worse.  I couldn't sleep till 3am (I ate there at 8pm), and even when I woke up I felt like I had something stuck in my stomach.  It was a feeling of being super full, my stomach just pushing against my clothes.  Felt so uncomfortable that I couldn't sleep.  Mind you, I have GERD, but haven't had any issues for months.  Also, my friend that took me there told me her friend with IBS ate here and felt horribly sick afterwards.  I don't know if it's all the fiber but something's up.  Thus, went down from 3 to 2 stars.  Just not for me.


Original Review:  

The shakes were great, had the Red Coconut one and I could taste both the strawberries and the coconut.  Very filling, like I would have been fine with just shake.

Mexican platter was good, but I didn't care for the rice.

Overall, it was good, not extremely flavorful, and maybe a bit too pricey.  Just OK for me.",0
"As I said last time I don't usually frequent chain-restaurants (or if I do, I hardly ever review them), but we had family over from London and they wanted to eat near or at Times Square.  Olive Garden is always a good call as it's prime location and if you get a window seat (which we did), then you are sure to be entertained by what ever is happening down below.  I don't really remember what we all ordered as I'm writing this review a few weeks later, but I don't remember any food poisoning or any complaints.  So I'm guessing we all had a normal, decent meal.  The service was excellent though.  We had a young guy from the Dominican Republic who was super-friendly and efficient.  Good bar service.",0
"Love!  Whitehall has become one of my favorite neighborhood spots for an early dinner or drink with friends.  I have always enjoyed Highlands, but grew sick of the constant crowd, so ventured to its sister bar around the corner and was not disappointed.  I'd give the drinks 5 stars, always inventive and the cocktail selections are changed seasonally.  There's always something new to try.  The food is very good as well.  Whitehall never disappoints.",0
"I hate to say it, this place has great prices, an attractive menu, and great and simple delivery......but it gave me food poisoning. Not ideal.  Had the chicken cobb and spent an entire day throwing up. Never been to it in person, this was only through delivery.  Thanks dudes.",1
"I first tried Patricia's when it was located further down East Tremont and I got sick because of the food. Went back a few times (I thought  just because I got sick the first time doesn't mean I should write the restaurant off) and I was never impressed with the food. Tried the food when they moved to the new location and my son got sick so I stopped going to the restaurant. My office has ordered from Patricia's a few times but I always avoided the food until recently. My office ordered from Patricia's a couple of weeks ago and I had a plate. The food was decent so last night, after a long day i decided to give them another shot and I am glad I did. I ordered the tuscano calamari, the fioretti boscaiola and the rib eye. Everything was delicious, I was so impressed! I don't know if they've changed chefs or what but I will be eating here again.",0
"I ordered the Wonton and Duck noodle soup.  I got food poisoning, a threw up my entire meal about 1-2 hours later.  I suspect it was undercooked meat in the wonton, not sure what else it could be.",1
"Horrible experience . food taste like soap. rice was hard , beans taste old, meat looks & taste horrible. did not enojoy at all .worst money spent ever. It made me sick , had  me throwing up for week. NEVER AGAIN .BEWARE !!!!",1
"This is my go-to dinner when I don't feel like cooking.  It's cheap ($6) and so good... I could eat this every week (and I have!) and not get sick of it.  I always order the same thing: a Veggie (plantains, avocado, black beans) and add Guyanese cheese.  The waitstaff is really friendly, too.",0
"Ordered a mushroom/garlic pizza last night.  The pizza tasted OK and the crust tasted a little different than your standard pizza, but the husband-man and I didn't really think anything of it.

Fast-forward to this morning and we're both sick with food poisoning.  

Avoid, avoid, avoid, unless you're willing to pay multiple visits to the porcelain god next day.",1
"Meh. The desserts in this place are just ok. The crack pie is prepackaged in small cardboard containers. The pie is shown all beautiful and in a complete pie and then you get this prepackaged thing. We took it back to our hotel and tried it.  I love love sweets but this was just so sickly. It was just pure sugar. The other one we tried was Candybar pie and it also was just too much. It was like every candy bar combined into one.

The place is super hard to find, but it's cute, tucked away on a quiet street. We only found it by looking for the actual address. Be warned that this is take out only.  Get your items and head on out. There is no where for you to sit or really to even stand and eat. 

There were lots of different options here and I loved the idea behind so many of them, but the execution just wasn't good. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. 3 stars.",0
"I wanted to like this place as it's right near my home. I really tried. I ordered from them many time. Up until I got food poisoned from the food they delivered. It appeared to have meat in it and made me really sick.
never again.",1
"Me and my boy Bob wanted to have a guys night out so we decided to run for the border. Hey, love the look and feel of the place, seems like it's been recently redone. If you go at the right time you can see a lot of Jets and Giants jerseys on the customers  so it makes me feel at home.

I've been eating at Taco Bell my entire life, my mom used to eat at one in Long Island while she was pregnant with me and knew the lady who worked behind the counter. The same woman worked there throughout my childhood and watched over me through highschool.  She still works at the same one til this day. As I graduated and moved away to Brooklyn (I got a nice computer design job) I sometimes need to stop in to a t-bell every once in a while to make me feel less home sick. 

This visit however made me hate home. I felt like my mom didn't come home tonight.

I ordered a T5 with a bonus cheesy gordita crunch, all vegetarian. And what I got was not up to par! The nachos only had nacho cheese and beans. Where's the sour cream and tomatoes!! Come on! And then my beautifully delicious CGC didn't even have beans in it! That is just not right. My taco supreme was correct but that was the weakest link to my classic order.

Needless to say Shawana, my server, was very kind, but she needs to get her staff into place! I love the bell and need to go back but I'm scared.",0
"I got sick a few weeks ago and ordered a lot of soup from this place. For the price, it's definitely good. Really cheap. And the lady who owns it is the sweetest! Always smiling and very friendly. Food comes out fast as well.",0
"This place is a total fucking joke. I placed an order on their website, NOT seamless. I received a confirmation email from them that my order was placed. After an hour of waiting, I called to check on my order. I called them more than 5 times and each time after a few rings a fax machine noise would come on. I have screen shots of both how many times I called and of my confirmation order. After the 7th time calling, a girl answered. When I asked that I was checking the status of my order(since it's been over an hour) all she said was that a bunch of orders had just went out. She didn't ask me what my name or what my order was. I then called back again when another 30 minutes went by. I stated that I had already called about my order. This was when the girl asked me for my name and order. She said she never received my order that I placed on their website. She said she ""doesn't know how it works."" ""Must be a glitch in the system."" Ummm what?! Oh and now they are closing. Never again. What a fucking waste of time. I'm home sick and I'm starving.",0
"Haven't had McDonald's for years. Home sick from work today and I woke up craving Mickey D's. While it didn't cure my sickness, the mcmuffin and hashbrown did give me great momentary enjoyment.",0
"I am struggling to see what the fuss is about with these burgers. My burger was dripping in an oil and water mix, my bun was soggy and my beef patty was bland. I actually couldn't finish it, as I was starting to feel sick in my stomach from all the grease. I'm glad it was under $5. I will say that the fries were nice and crispy as one positive. If you have a sensitive stomach, don't eat here.",0
"Well, I tried them a few times even though I saw many bad reviews. The products are okay but not any to rave about. However, last Thursday I decided to get some treats because of Halloween and lo and behold, they were shut down by the health department. There was a sticker on their door that was closed. The sticker was from the health department. So, now I am not skeptical about the other reviews where people got sick eating their products. I usually tend not to do reviews but I just thought I had to say what I saw because I am vegan and I like to find good quality products. Vegan Divas prices are on the high end and I expect a high end product.
It is just very scary to know a place was closed by the health department, I can only imagine what's going on in there.",0
"I placed an order at 6:45 and it's now 8:30. I called brooklyn label which is a block from my house asking where my food is. A very rude guy on the phone said they never received my order from seamless and he has no idea what im calling about and hung up on me.
I'm sick with a flu and have nothing to eat and was really counting on that veggie burger.
After waiting for 30 min on the phone for customer service i was told they will refund me my money. No apologies, no explanations, no descount coupon, like GrubHub would do. Nothing. Well that is what you'll get from me now, nothing.
Thanks for screwing up my night and my dinner, seamless.",0
"Kiku is horrible. DO NOT GET THE OYSTERS!! My girlfriend got food poisoning and the waitress was very unhelpful and rude. I had very high expectations because of the good reviews here but this restaurant is clearly overrated. 

I was extremely dissatisfied with Kiku and I don't plan on going back there anytime soon. Don't go, except if you'd like to get food sick",1
"Honestly this place would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for what happened today. Won't say that its a horrible place because that would be a lie. Ever since Tomo opened in my area I instantly started buying food there. Let's just say sometimes I bought food from Tomo on a 3 time a week basis. The driver already recognized my face and so did the staff at the restaurant, they always said hello when they saw me at the restaurant. When I didn't order in a while, some staff would tell me, ""hi long time, how have you been?"" Yes I ordered that much! Around April of this year I ordered some sushi, ate it and it was yummy as usual! The next day I had to call out of work because I was so ill with food poisoning. Despite of this I still ordered food from here. I even moved to another neighborhood and still ordered from there. I ordered some Philadelphia rolls today and asked for the salmon to be cooked.(The salmon is smoked) I don't like to eat anything raw. When I received the sushi some parts of the salmon looked cooked while others were raw. I called back and let them know. I was told that it was cooked and that there was no way it was not.  I felt like they really didn't care after all the business that I have given. My orders were big and not less than 25 dollars most of the time. Considering that and the fact they already recognized me I thought the would fix this by simply sending my order how I asked for it. I asked the lady over the phone to remove my info as I no longer want to do business with them. She replied with a simple, ""ok we will remove."" The reason I asked for this is because they had a habit of leaving my credit cards on file. When they would print the receipt my full credit card number would be on there! So yes they lost a customer, a really good one I truly made lots of business for them! Doesn't take away from their great food but it's also about CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",0
"Now this is real Pizza!!! I'm so sick of seeing all these fast food style pizza shops that sell slices. Once you try this you'll never patronize one of the slice shops again. Totonno's is right up at the top with Patsy's and John Pizzeria in West Village. Totonno's is great because I don't have to go into Manhattan, always a plus!!",0
"ATTENTION:

Those in the NYC area should avoid the BELL DINER located on Bell Blvd and 73RD Ave in BAYSIDE...unless you actually like food poisoning.

They're not cheap, the food ain't good...and...it made me and my girlfriend sick on 11-3--13.",1
"I went here this past Saturday night for my girlfriend's friend's 26th birthday party. The place was over crowded and quite LOUD. It was probably a mistake coming here around Halloween. There were tons of loud drunks and assholes everywhere in costume. Now believe me I love loud drunk assholes more than anyone and on occasion I can be quite the loud drunk asshole myself but this was over the top. They really need to have some type of control and kick people out when it is getting to be too much. The constant screaming, chanting and yelling can get old. There was a drunken Pillsbury doughboy throwing Philadelphia Rolls at a Zombie who was chugging sake out of a bottle that looked like Moonshine. 

The food sucked. The rolls were small and didn't taste right. None of the seafood tasted fresh. The beer was shitty tap beer and was warm. The service was pretty good and they were quick; however when you are bringing unwanted shitty food and drinks to the table that resemble trash it defeats the purpose of good service. 

As if things couldn't get worse I decided to take a piss in the bathroom in the back. Walking through the sea of drunks was quite difficult. I finally got to the bathroom and it was disgusting. It looked like Hepatitis was created there. There was a large amount of rust and dirt all over. I pushed the lock on the door and regretted it immediately. I said to myself ""GOD DAMMIT THAT DOOR COULD HAVE JUST GAVE ME GHONNORHEA"" I scrubbed my hands thoroughly with boiling hot water and soap. This was a life saver. I then went on to pee and flushed the toilet bowl with my foot to avoid any further possible disease contraction. 

I do not suggest coming here unless you are with 12 of your boys and want to black out in 2 hours. If you want to get food poisoning and Hepatitis A-Z this is a great spot for that as well!  STAY AWAY!",0
"Although it was a little too cold to be hanging outside drooling over the 75 food vendors' various offerings, we managed and were glad we did.

Almost everything we tried was amazing. I have no idea how these vendors maintain such excellent quality while cooking outside under a tent. 

Pizza Moto - nearly perfect. I tried the white pizza with grilled Brussels sprouts. I think I would have enjoyed a red pie a bit more, but the quality of the crust and the ingredients cannot be beat. They cook on a mobile coal fired oven that maintains a perfectly even 800° temperature. They were great guys who were willing to sit around and discuss the moisture content of the dough being the secret to a crispy exterior and chewy interior crust. I loved them and their fabulous pizzas and if I ever have the opportunity I will be back for more. 

Milk Truck - breakfast grilled cheese sandwich:  this sandwich included two fried eggs, caramelized onions and thick slices of cheddar cheese for a perfectly melted treat. I substituted the rosemary bread for the Rye that the sandwich typically comes on and I'm so glad I did. The rosemary bread had significant flavor on its own but after being brushed with a sick layer of butter and grilled it was amazingly decadent and delicious. The only thing that could have made it better is something vinegary or spicy. I borrowed a spicy mustard from one of my friends meals and added it. Amazing. 

Handsome Hank's fish and chips: so good it called to me, a vegetarian, to try it. I've never eaten seafood so I'm not sure what type of fish it was but it was large chunks of beautifully battered, crunchy fried fish. The tartar sauce was perfect and even the fries were great. 

Queen Cobra Thai massaman curry: interesting composition, nice flavors, but not the best food I ate at this market. They start with a layer of mashed potatoes in the bottom of the bowl, then layer on onions and carrots, pour over the curry and top it with shredded coconut and crushed peanuts. The peanuts added a texture that I did not care for, but it was still really good and the roti fried in butter fresh in front of you is awesome. 

I'm not sure of the vendors' name but two of my friends ate tuna tartare tacos and thought they were the most amazing thing that they'd ever eaten. 

The only disappointment of the day for me was the Mexican hot chocolate stand. If it's 35° and windy out and I pay six dollars for a cup of hot chocolate I expect it to be hot, not room temperature / slightly cool.",0
"this is probably one of the few restaurants that give you more than what you pay for- i was literally stuffed full like a thanksgiving turkey by the end of the meal.  but in total, the food was great.  i split the fried chicken biscuit sandwich and vegetable omelette with my friend.  the chicken was cooked just right, but the biscuit was a lil dry.   the omelette was a nice balance to the heavy meal and huge proportions.  i couldn't give this place 5 stars though, bc as good as it was, there was just nothing too amazing about a biscuit sandwich.  maybe bc the food was so heavy, i also felt a lil sick after the meal.  but for those who don't mind a heavy meal, i highly recommend it!",0
"My review is based on delivery.  I was home sick and wanted comfort food and boy, did I choose the right place.  I got the chicken soup with pelmeni, the stuffed cabbage, the beet salad and the sirnik.  Everything was delicious like it was homemade by a Russian grandma.  I especially like the stuffed cabbage.",0
"The pizza is not the greatest around, but it's basically the cheapest way to eat if you're worried about paying your rent next month. You can reasonably share one of their enormous slices with somebody else and feel full, and it'll cost you $4. Too broke for that and/or sick of pizza? Get 4 garlic knots with marinara for $1.",0
"We wanted to try some good Italian while in NYC so we looked at the ZAGAT list of best restaurants in town. We decided on Pepolino based on their online menu, which turned out to be outdated. Regardless of this initial setback, we were happy with our choice. 
We started ordering the polenta. I'm not a fan of polenta, but the sauce was so good the polenta was barely noticeable! 
My brother ordered the spinach and ricotta gnocchi with butter and sage sauce. I wanted to try the gnocchi as well, but having tried butter sauces from several upscale restaurants in the last few months, I was hesitant. Butter sauces I had tried before were just too buttery and made me sick. So I asked for a creamy sauce instead. The chef was hesitant about the change but was willing to accommodate. 
When our dishes were served, I tried the butter and sage sauce from my brother's gnocchi and it was really good!  Nothing like the other sauces I had tried before. I hereby apologize to the chef for replacing his brilliant choice of sauce. However, the creamy sauce I got instead was also really good. It might have a lot to do with the fact that the gnocchi itself was outstanding. Having a chef being flexible with picky eaters like myself is definitely appreciated. For dessert we tried the panna cotta. The sauce was supposed to be strawberry, but you couldn't really tell.",0
"I'm new to the neighborhood and, gosh,this juice bar is such a gift to our community. The owner takes pride in customizing every drink. Are you tired? Hungover? Sick? He has the perfect tonic to energize your body. This is so much more than your main stream Jamba Juice or Juice Revolution. Oasis Juice bar treats food as medicine. I'm completely hooked!",0
"I just got home and showered and can't contain myself. This is the best sandwich that I have ever split with one of my best friends in my LIFE! AHHHHHHHHHHH! I WANT TO LIVE IN BROOKLYN SUB. No joke. The only things you need to know is that they can put almost anything you want on to a sandwich for a ridiculously cheap amount of money and that they turn off their grills by 6pm. I almost don't even know what the hell we got because Ingrid hasn't really eaten in like 2-3 days from stress. BUT Zaneta I think got a sub sandwich with sesame seed bun with jerk turkey or smoked jerk turkey of some sorts with jack cheese, tomato, lettuce, tiny bit of mayo, vinegar & oil, and jalapenos. Lots of freaking jalapenos. And I got another beer and plopped down and poured that dog fish head into a styrofoam cup. I say that I can live here because they have everything you could ever want and bare with me I have a photogenic memory: toilet paper, towels, advil, sanitary pads, cat/dog food, fresh fruit!, mixers, amy's soup, oreos, amy's organic bunny & the parmesan mac & cheese, gold fish crackers, ramen noodles, kraft dinner, cereals, organic cookies, chips ahoy, pepperidge farm, those hazelnut pieruette twirl cookies you dip in coffee that are amazing, a million kinds of chips/nuts: including party mix with both sun chips, dorritos & cheetos. You've got to be kidding me. I can seriously keep going. I have issues. But I also want to live in this store. It's the best thing since Jesus. Also, WAY fresher than Subway and doesn't make me want to vomit after ingesting it. Two thumbs up. Zaneta would also like to thank me for remembering that this exists after I exclaimed I was hungry after losing tremendously in an arousing game of pub trivia at St. Catherine's. I do not know my politics/history but apparently I got several sports questions right that I pulled out of my ass. Brooklyn Sub FTW.",0
"why one star? for one i feel i got tricked into eating here because of the star average...im sick of it! so i want this to be easy to understand why i didnt like it. me and my boyfriend came here the other night for dinner. 
we ordered 
1. mac and cheese fritters -the inside was pretty good cheese saucey but lacked a lil flavor... what made the mac and chees fritters worthy of one star? totally and completely OVER SALTED after i ate one i picked up another one to look at it and i could actually see chunks of salt it killed any mac and cheese flavor, i had to drink sooo much water after that.
2. shrimp and grits - the first bite of the grits was yummy creamy and good but after a few more bites i realized i was eating what tasted like pure spoonfuls of BUTTER witch i love but this was sooo much my stomach hurt. what made the shimp and grits worthy of only one star? the shrimp were NOT CLEANED!! eeww who wants to eat shimp poop?
3. chicken and waffles - chicken was again super super super salty and the after taste was of pure fennel seed. meat was juicy tho. waffle was ok a little mushy for my liking.

all in all i totally felt like i wasted $50 on gross food.",0
"My b/f and I just moved into the neighborhood about a month ago. I had a curiosity about Hookahs since I'd never done it before. Since Babylons is right around the corner from us, I convinced my b/f to try it even though he was a little reluctant. We went there around 7 p.m. which was a little early apparently, but we just caught happy hour, so our (plain) Hookah only cost us $20. I thought this was reasonable, but then again, I don't know being that this was our first time. 

Anyway, it was an interesting experience for me. I was a little nervous because I am not a smoker (of anything). I did find myself coughing after almost every inhalation, but I  found that more embarrassing than annoying because I felt like everyone would know I was an amateur! lol Babylon's itself is small. We were seated in the back right across from the bathroom, & we found the table we were placed at to be a bit of a tight squeeze as we were placed right next to a couple that we didn't know. That definitely did not allow for private conversation. But I suppose that that smallness could be looked at as being cozy. 

The Hookah itself did give me a bit of a ""giddy"" feeling. Then again, that could have been the 2 glasses of wine that I drank along with it... I'm not sure.  lol My b/f started out liking it but by the end of the evening (which was about an hour later for us), he started feeling sick, so we left. I was disappointed that I didn't get to stay long enough to see the belly dancer, who I was told comes on around 10 or 11. I don't remember there being a DJ and there was definitely no dancing going on at that time, but as mentioned, we were there early. If I were to decide to go to Babylons again, it might just be for drinks and not the Hookah (I don't think this will become my ""thing""), and it would definitely be later in the evening so that I can catch the belly dancer.

P.S. Really cool fish tank!",0
i just order delivery from here and the fish was sooo not fresh. I ordered from here because of the discount on seamless. The shrimp tempera roll was ok but the spicy salmon roll and the salmon appetizer was fishy and the texture was weird. Will not order from her again. Thank god i didn't get sick,0
My friend and I visited this place on a Friday evening. Very cute setting and friendly staff pulled us in. We ordered drinks and food. I had a margarita that tasted like alcohol poisoning at first sip so I traded that in for a sangria. It was better. Food was blaaah. I wasn't impressed with my steak at all. It was over cooked :-( their empanadas were great though. It was a little pricey. I doubt I'd return,0
"This is the 2nd or 3rd time that I've been to Epicerie Bouloud.  Unfortunately after eating their vegetable quiche, I got food poisoning and vomited all night long.  Seems that their food is not so fresh.",1
"Went here before seeing the Jimmy Fallon show when Pearl Jam played.  Ordered drinks at the bar.  They were delicious and promptly made, although both did not have the garnishes they were supposed to come with.  Vanilla vodka martini was supposed to have a vanilla bean (did not) and old fashion was supposed to have a cherry and an orange (no orange).  We ordered the crab dip which was...weird. Luke warm and fell apart, like crumbles.  Later that night I was violently ill and my husband was later in the morning.  Obviously we have no proof it was the crab, but others were eating the other things we ate that night with us and we were the only two that got sick, so....",1
"I found this place because to all the yelp reviews.  We liked it so much the first time we visited that we decided to come back another day.  The 2nd time we came back I got sick, and since what I ate here was the only thing I had that day,  I can safely narrow it down to this restaurant.

First off, we ordered a variety of dishes that included:  stir fried sliced pork belly, crispy chicken with spicy garlic sauce, a noodle dish with meat (sorry but I forgot which specific one), crispy orange chicken, and peppered steak.  Everything was very good!!  The sliced pork belly was a little greasy, but that is kinda expected with pork.

I would have rated the place at 4 to 4.5 stars on my first visit.  Probably the best and most authentic Chinese food I have ever had, and I go to china town in SF once or twice a year.

The 2nd time we came, we ordered almost everything the same except for the pork belly, of which I ordered it cooked a different way.  I got the double cooked sliced pork belly this time around.  I did not have anything to eat till we came here for lunch, so an hour and a half later.... when things got unpleasant,  it was an easy guess where I got sick from.  It may be the oil they used or something like that because, um, lets just say things looked oily when my stomach got upset.  I had to dock a star for this.

Honestly,  I probably would still come back if I were in NYC again.  Its still a solid place and the food was pretty good.  Hopefully that upset stomach was an isolated experience.",1
I get sick even thinking about the food I ordered from here. Pastrami over hummus was not what i expected. When i got closer to the container I smelt some strange curry type smell and started to gag. I was whatever about that and moved on to the lamb and  chicken kebab. The chicken was good....until i took a bigger sized cube and noticed it was raw inside. Didn't know it was so hard to fully cook simple white meat chicken. Silly me..I should have just had Sahara...,0
"This place sneakily hides their C rating from the Department of Health behind their door. Not surprising since they regularly have uncooked kabobs just lying around unrefrigerated.

But I still give it 3 stars... I'm sure similar street carts are no worse and I still spring for the $1.25 chicken skewers at least once a week. And... I've never gotten sick or anything. Fingers crossed.

Be sure to get them spicy!",0
"Pros: 

(+) Old school diner look with a modern twist
(+) They sell ice cream and shakes
(+) French fries!

Cons: 

(-) Food poisoning from raw hamburger meat!
(-) Workers at the food prep station was unsanitary (read details below)
(-) Why are the straws way in the back near the restrooms? But the drinks are at the front? Shouldn't the straws be near the drinks by default? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All I have to say is....what the hell happen to this place? 

Clarke's is a fairly new place, just opened this year. If you are a local, then you should already know that prior to Clarke's this place was initially another burger joint called ""GoodBurger"". However GoodBurger was everything but a good burger joint for the simple fact that the service was horrible, slow and the food was mediocre. When GoodBurger closed down to make it's way for this new place Clarke's Standard, my heart beat the tempo of promise. As a matter of fact, the first couple months was excellent! If I did my review a couple months ago, I would have given the place a 5 star just for the simple fact that the place was fully staffed with people who had excellent customer service, quick, friendly and on top of that, the burgers were on point and flavorful! Don't even get me started on the french fries. I had  become an addict, that I had to enter the ""Say No to French Fries Rehab Clinic."" No lie, it used to take me 5 minutes to get my entire meal and the manager at the time (Anthony) would walk up and down the kitchen to make sure things were running smoothly. 

Fast forward 2 months on hiatus from this place for the simple fact that this place was too addicting. Now I ask this, what the hell happened to this place? Since I last came, the quality of this place just plummeted like the Great Depression stock market! The old manager here transferred to a different location, there is now different staff, the food was horrible and the service was slow! 

I had ordered my usual burger meal that used to only take 5 minutes on a busy day...and this day it was almost 20 minutes on a slow day and I was still standing waiting for my meal. I walked over to the grill area and there were 2 cooks at the grill. I saw a hispanic girl prepping a burger, and naturally I thought she was prepping mine. But she looked at me and took a huge bite out of the hamburger! What? Did my eyes just see correctly? She was straight eating a hamburger from the grill! The second cook was a guy texting away on his phone with his gloves still on and spatula in hand! Don't believe me, see picture here: http://alturl.com/22q89 Is that even sanitary? I made a complaint to the cashier asking what was taking so long. 
The cashier yelled at the cooks, ""she's been standing here for a long time, where's her burger!?"" One of the cooks asked ""what did she order?"" which confirms to me that they never made my order. The girl who was probably eating the hamburger at the grill was probably eating MY order! SMH. Don't they have a break room to eat their food or eat at the table like the rest of the people during their breaks? I don't think she was on her break though because she was in between eating her burger and tending to the fries.

So, I had to wait another few minutes for my burger. I was on my lunch break so my time was limited since I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for my food. By the time I got back to work, I took 1 bite out of my burger just to find it still RAW! I had asked for medium-well done and I got medium-RAW. Picture: http://alturl.com/7mu9j
The lettuce was old and not crisp at all, it had browning spots on it with mushy edges. There was no time for me to take the burger back since my lunch break was over so I threw it out. It was horrible! I barely had any time to finish my fries. But still somehow after eating whatever I had, I ended up having food poisoning and was sent home early from work. 

What's going on Clarke's? I used to love this place. But the way it is now, not so much. Looked like I was having de-ja-vu all over again with GoodBurger since it seems like that's the route this place is heading right now until they make some serious changes.",1
"Overrated...... I feel sick to my stomach- and I eat anything. Had their ""famous"" pork hot dog. I would avoid this place. It's 2 hours later and I feel the same as when I finished it- Sick",0
"This is one place that i recommend to visiting travelers. Honestly it has a taste that you can never get sick of and when the word shack is mentioned I have to go. 

The lines maybe very intimidating but they go fast and definitely worth the small wait. Also if possible it is better to eat the burgers as soon as you get them. 

One of thee best places for burgers ever.",0
"2.5 star

this is the SAME place as the Mentaiko ramen placed where I got food poisoning from that was shut down just a month or 2 ago. 

And I believe the same owner and same staffs.  And the interior was exactly the same as Mentaiko ramen. They did not re-renovate at all

Me being a groupon queen, I came with another groupon on a Wednesday night. And this place was empty. We were the only customers throughout the whole dinner. 

Soup: egg drop and hot and sour: both were just ok. Definitely had better

Appetizer: tang tang noddle: super salty again. with tons of MSG..nothing special 

Entree: beef stew: super lack in flavor and it was labeled as being very spicy but it was not spicy at all. Hot pepper chick: the worst one of all. Not authentic at all. Too much breading and no flavor. 

Service: decent. I almost felt bad for the waitress working for such a slow place 

overall: not authentic Sichuan food at all. Go to the one on St marks, or even Hot Kitchen just around the corner. I am just happy at least this time, I didn't get food poisoning again.

sorry but i won't be coming back again",0
"Catered from here twice. Both times the food was delicious and packed full of flavor and spices. The most recent time a few of my colleagues and I got extremely bad food poisoning. We think it was from the green and white sauces because those squirt bottles are a cesspool for bacteria if not cleaned properly. By the time I got to the lunch room the only items left were the cous cous, squash, and sauce. I packed my plate with cous cous and a few pieces of squash and drenched my plate with the green and white sauce. It had to be the sauces. I would easily cater from here again if it weren't for the torrid aftermath of the meal. I spent 14 hours in the bathroom.",1
"This is a review on Cooler Cleanse from Juice Generation. I decided to do a 3-day juice cleanse with my friend. We both had no experience with juice cleansing, but thought we would give it a try. We were trying to obtain that ""energetic"" ""detoxed"" feeling that everyone speaks about!

Well, we both hated the juices. They were in no way filling and extremely sweet or extremely sour (spicy lemonade). In no way did we feel satisfied, tired, energetic, or ""cleansed."" We both felt sick, hungry, and irritated at the cost of this 3-day cleanse ($170) and the ripped-off feeling we had. Both of us felt sick and ended the cleanse a day early. Juice generation cooler cleanse called to ask how I was feeling. I told her I was sick, really did not enjoy it, and didn't feel well, (even today a few days later I'm still not functioning normally!) all she said was ""let me know if you have any other questions or comments."" I would NOT recommend this. It is a marketing/advertising trap!!!!",0
I ate here a couple of times now and every time I end up getting sick. I had the rotisserie chicken and the chicken stew. I won't be giving them another chance. To food poison me again.,1
Best Jewish deli hands down! I had a major surgery this year and for about 2 months straight all I had was their chicken soup and I still crave it and will never get sick of it! Mmmmm just got in the mood to order some now lol! All of their food is so tasty!,0
This place is the saddest excuse for a restaurant. The food was under cooked. The staff was rude and incompetent. The so called lollipop chicken was raw inside which made me sick. Do your self a favor and never step foot in here.,1
"The pizza here is really excellent. It serves as a very good substitute if the wait is too long, or if you get sick of the slightly better pizza, at Adrienne's nearby.

Much like Adrienne's, the best thing to get here is the Old-Fashioned Square Pie. They have most of the typical toppings you could want to load it up with. I usually like a nice meaty one, and they top it pretty well with adequate pepperoni and sausage. Some slices are lacking a bit sometimes, but overall it's pretty solid.

The other food here is pretty good as well. I've tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parm, which both provide for a satisfying meal.

I often order up from here, but the dine-in experience is good too. It's a nice, dark atmosphere with decent service. This is one of the few really good choices for both a nice meal out, or ordering in if you are in the Financial District.",0
"This review applies to the Pronto Pizza at :
30 West 48th St. between 6th Ave. and 5th Ave. NYC.  They did not have a place to write about them so i went to this site.

STAY AWAY from Pronto Pizza at address above - Their food  (pizza) is not properly contained nor cooked nor heated high enough.  On Friday (Nov. 1, 2013)  two of us who ate there at 2:45 got extreme food poisoning starting at 5 pm that night and were violently ill at our hotel for the next day and a half.  Could not move out of bathroom nor bed !  
Was just like rotovirus.

Hotel staff had to be called in to help us and also a Dr. !   Never felt so badly in all our lives.   
What started as a beautiful trip to the Marathon turned out to be a nightmare and almost killed us.

They will be reported to Board of Health and BBB and tv. stations and papers  in NYC.
Beware!  Would not wish this on anyone!

The establishment on West 48th should be shut down by the Board of Health.",1
"This place is terrible. I had a relatively expensive but bland chicken burrito and then promptly got food poisoning. Forget being around for 20+ years, which the sign says and suckered me into trying it - I can't imagine there's a lot of repeat business based on the fact their food makes customers ill. Never going back.",1
"Yes, I made a Yelp account just to write a review for this place.

I was once an employee of Pizza Mania. 

This place is a real shithole. The owner, ""Hezzi"" is an absolute nut job. With total disregard for sensible American labor laws, he subjects his employees to long hours, sweatshop conditions,  and minimal pay. 

Hezzi is a power-tripping businessman who cuts corners, pinches every penny possible, and doesn't care about customer service let alone basic cleanliness. 

I am ashamed to have served such terrible, greasy, and unhealthy food to so many people in those 4 days. Even though I needed the money, quitting was one of the best things I ever did. Hearing the owner try to curse me off and threaten to ""take me outside and punch me in the face"" put a smile on my face and I am glad to now look back on that dark and cold time in my life. 

Please don't eat here, you actually might get sick",0
"If you want to get sick eat here. 
I took my girlfriend here while visiting NYC since she is Czech and wanted to have some authentic Czech food. She ordered the chicken schnitzel lunch plate. It came out under-cooked. So much the inside was still pink. Most chicken contains Salmonella unless cooked thoroughly so this was not only unacceptable -  but bacteria ridden. She returned it. Instead of cooking up a new one the ""cook"" just added more batter and threw it back in the fryer. When it came back it was the texture of dried shoe leather and almost impossible to cut. Inedible. When she kindly asked to speak to the owner or manager it turns out he wasn't there. No one there was Czech. She kindly asked the ""cook"" about returning it and getting her money back. He noted she had already eaten the potato salad. He defended the chicken shit meal like it was normal and look how many people eat here. At this point I got up and voiced loudly the fact he served an undercooked raw chicken and then returned one that was consistent with a shoe sole. He got angry and indignant. That somehow we were in the wrong. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE UNLESS YOU CRAVE CRAP FOOD AND ABUSE OR GETTING BACTERIAL DYSENTERY.",0
"This is a really nice place. I ordered the tempura salmon and it was tasty. This place would have gotten 5 stars from me, is the sick waitress didn't accidentally cough on my food.",0
My friends brought this back to the apartment for me to try because I was feeling too sick from the alchy I had before at the bar.. But when they brought it home.. I'm so glad they did! It was really yummy!! The meat and the rice mixed together with the white sauce they had.. Idk what it's called but boy was it good! The rice went so well with all the meat.. And the pita bread on top was so good with everything in it as well.. Maybe i was just super hungry from yacking cause of the alcohol.. But it was super yummy!! Glad I got to try it!!,0
"Traveled to the smith from Brooklyn because usually it's delicious. I took a seat at the bar. And sat. And sat. And sat. Now, I'm a bartender so I understand being busy, however there was no one besides me at the bar. Sitting. After over 10 minutes without acknowledgement I left. On my way out I inquired about the service to which the manager replied ""oh yeah we usually have a bartender but she's out sick"". It would have been nice to know before I wasted my time not only traveling to, but sitting at the smith waiting.",0
"I've been to many bars before and the atmosphere is always about the same... Get carded.. Sit down.. Order some shots or drinks... Get drunk (or for most cases feel sick)... Yack... THE END. Well today.. This place changed it up a bit for me.. EVERYONE here is super nice! We got seated at the bar right away by the nice hostess... Then we were greeted by two bartenders... One JUST SO HAPPENS to be the owner of Patron Mexican Grill.. He was the nicest most chill bar owner ever. Most owners don't stand there and bother talking to their customers.. This guy let me add as much mango as I wanted to my mango margarita.. And I mean.. I squeezed it myself!! And theeeenn!! After a few sips of the margarita and two patron shots... I had the balls to ask him to take a picture with me for yelp!! He not only said yes.. He told me to come behind the bar!! SO I DID!! We took a picture and then he let me ring the cow bell!! It was all so fun!! He made my night for sure!! The place is so lively and the drinks were not cheap on the booze.. You definitely will feel it! So glad I made a stop by here during my visit to NYC. 

THANK YOU LOUIE FOR MAKING MY BAR EXPERIENCE MEMORABLE IN NYC! Love yah!",0
"This place is a gem! The best Italian food in the city. My boyfriend and I come here about 3 times a month...we live right around the corner. Amazing service and food. High quality ingredients in a romantic setting. The owner Phil, who grew up in the city is such a pleasure and nice guy to talk to if you get the chance.

Favorites:
Chicken Soup (sans noodles) - the BEST in the city!!! Hearty veggies, and will also do the trick if ever sick
Calamari, lightly breaded to perfection
Eggplant Parm, the first time I've ever had this and was very pleased. Nice texture and flavor *signature dish of theirs
Pasta Primavera, this isn't on the menu but it's my go-to and delicious! Again, so many hearty veggies; mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, zucchini and yellow squash.
Penne Chicken Alfredo - my boyfriend's must when we go to any Italian restaurant. He can't compare anything to this. I also love it to dip my bread in (that's my small tolerance to alfredo sauce in general).
They also provide a basket with italian and foccaccia breads. It's so fresh and served with olive oil. 

We've never been here for lunch, but I have a feeling it gets quite a crowd with all of the agencies in the area. They have a nice bar with TV's too. They are closed on Saturdays/Sundays, but it's the perfect Friday night spot if you're in the area.",0
"i was seat at the bar with my Girlfriend we have calamari and stake tartar (wine, drink and service always good) stake tartar with mexican spice and other salsa is not tartar they completely F...up the dish . The calamari same thing Really disgusting plus my Girl friend got sick i taste was really wiard spice and old taste please stay away from this 2 dish",1
"Nope... I'm good.. No thank you.

Let me preface by saying that I am a southern biscuit junkie.  I love visiting family down south just to get biscuits from pretty much anywhere because they are all good.  I even asked folks in SC for recipes so I could master them on my own. 

My co worker sent me a link for Empire biscuit since he knows me and my inner fat girl very well. Once I looked at the menu and saw ""Scotch Egg with Cheddar and Whole Grain Mustard"" and ""Spiced Fried Chicken, Pickled Carrots, Sauce a l'Orange"" I knew immediately that they were trying to hard to be different and it wasn't going to be up to par.  I ignored my gut and went anyways.  

We trekked from midtown to alphabet city. I couldn't order the southern style biscuit because it has pork lard in it ( I don't eat pork). I ordered the all butter biscuit spiced fried chicken sandwich with a sweet tea. 

YUCK!!!!!!!! WTF!

Biscuit = crumbly salty and dry 
Spiced Chicken = tasted like it had Indian spices in it which did not go well with the pickled carrots and the sauce a l'orange or the damn salty ass biscuit.
Pickled Carrots/Sauce = nasty especially on a biscuit.

Just what I freaking thought!!!  

Hipsters.... Yeah i'm talking to you.  PLEASE stop opening restaurants trying to be cool and different but falling short on taste.  I'm truly sick of all these trendy or gimmicky places where you spend $13.06 for a damn biscuit sandwich and a iced tea and all you end up doing is eating the biscuit only because the rest of it tastes terrible.

Lesson learned: Every city, state and country has their specialties.  Just because NYC is a melting pot doesn't mean that you will be able to reproduce something amazing found somewhere else.  Leave the ""southern"" biscuit to the southerners. 

Love, 

Highly pissed and drinking a smoothie to make up for that hot mess.",0
"There was a point in time where I would write reviews for everything because I wanted to be a yelp elitist; however with nursing school these days, my time has become extremely limited, and so now I only write reviews for the worthy.

I have been on a royal pudding binge ever since I discovered them at paris bakery, so I was ecstatic when I noticed an offer for buy 2, get 1 free of their pudding on my facebook ads (ecstatic because paris bakery will no longer hold a monopoly of royal pudding in NYC, and cause as an asian/broke nursing student, I love a deal).  So on a late Tuesday afternoon with 30 minutes of free time between running errands all day, I quickly stopped by and grabbed one of each pudding flavor and flew out that door to my next appointment. 

Verdict: 
-Green Tea: (one of my two faves) they were generous with the matcha so I could also feel the texture of the matcha, which I am quite a fan of 
-Tofu: (second fave): If you have ever eaten freshly made soft tofu dessert (dafufa), it was kind of like that.
-Black sesame: I wasn't as fond of it, BUT I have recently attempted to make a buttload of my own black sesame royal pudding and I've gotten sick the taste of black sesame, so did I not do that, I'm pretty sure I would have loved it too
-Coffee: Good. It even had that light whitish foam up on top and a thin layer of coffee gelatin on the bottom. (Although I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was more of a thick espresso kind of sauce consistency)
-Mango: good and very fragrant. My study buddies were able to smell it when I opened it
-Strawberry: unlike paris bakery's strawberry that is all vanilla with strawberry sauce on the bottom, all their flavors were completely blended.  I do like paris bakery's strawberry better for that reason, but it was still good

One suggestion that I would like to make is that I would like a thin sauce kinda jam thing on the bottom layer (the green tea kind of had it, but I think it was from the matcha settling on the bottom).  The tofu is fine, although I think it would be cute to put maybe a thin layer of honey of the bottom?

ANYWAY! overall: LOVE it, joint is cute and small and I will return for sure (plus I want to try the crepes).  Some people have bitched about the price, but I think it's about average considering it's NYC and they come in the cutest little containers that I have been using to re-grow my scallions in =)",0
"usually i am not a fan of food delivery. unless i am sick... 

ordered the pad thai dinner special (comes with a soup & a drink) and it rocked my wold!!! 
- the soup was something between miso and chicken broth and tastes perfectly salty for my dimmed taste buds
- pad thai had less noodles and more chicken & bean sprouts. this is something i absolutely loved and will definitely come back for. 

another thing i loved was the small side of  jalapeños that came with my order. 


not sure what the space looks like, but will check it out next time I am in the area and having a pad thai craving",0
"This is one of our favorite places to just stop buy if we don't have other dinner plans on a Saturday night. The staff is great and always really friendly and the menu is great.

We normally just order a bunch of appetizers and tomato soup and of course a bottle of wine or a couple of drinks. This is one of the only places were I really enjoy ordering drinks! But lately no matter what I order I am disappointed. I might just have grown tired of the menu because I am here a lot, or they are doing sometime different. 

They still get four stars from be because I still recommend it to all my friends. So if you are looking for a laid back place to share something small and have some drinks this is definitely the place....

...Or if you are just craving tomato soup, because that is yummy no matter how sick I am of everything else on the menu.",0
"Had this last night. Was some of the best Chinese food I've tasted in a while. I just wish it didn't give me food poisoning, forcing me to throw up an hour or two later. I ordered broccoli, so they must've tried real hard to mess that up.",1
"wow. Just wow. This suburban white boy stumbled onto this place during a delivery to the Bronx. This place absolutely blows away the fake junk they are serving in Manhattan. 

SUPER nice staff, and the food was on point! I love when someone tells me something is spicy, and it ACTUALLY IS! 

The goat curry was freakin amazing, spiced to perfection. I also had some mystery meat that the gentlemen behind the counter kept calling ""duck,"" but it wasn't duck. Anyways, that was freakin amazing as well. 

All this with a veggie samosa for 16 bucks. Sick deal, great establishment!",0
Long wait longer the. Expected. Treated poorly by the waiter. To top it off we got food poisoning. Only good thing was the stoli elite. Bartender didn't add vermouth to a martini. I would not recommend,1
brought two bacon and egg on a roll sandwich's went home  upon opening them notice  mouse dropping in the rolled up paper. drove back to location with the mouse poop in tacked in rapping was greeted by this young guy who  cursed at me and told me to get out of store we got a A rating f--k you he said to me.   i put complaint in board of health and i would not step foot into this  dirty filthy Establishment for fear of getting sick  if you ever go in place look at all the dirt around food prep area they should be closed by the city health dept.  dirty attire  no hair nets  don't use gloves touch money then your food  gross. i for one will never purchase from this bagel store,0
"Not the biggest fan of their regular meals but when I am sick or hungover, Mees's eggdrop soup with wantons is the most wonderful thing on the planet. An inexpensive and quick fix for many ales. The only bummer is they serve Pepsi and not coke. Coke is a much needed part of my stomach cure.
    The interior of Mee is like most cheap Chinese places the only difference being when you order takeout. You have to pick it up outside from a window, after you've ordered inside.",0
"So...per the review from the former employee of Bud's on this page...Bud's is finished. Walked by tonight on my way back from the movie theater and was shocked to see it dark on a Saturday night with two pieces of printer paper stuck on the door that just say 'CLOSED'. After my last visit I figured it got shut down by the board of health but I guess they just weren't paying their bills..?

I had two unmemorable experiences here. The service both times was horrendous and the food was DISGUSTING. Came 2 weeks ago to watch football with a group of people and got some appetizer platters. The food all came out cold, the dips looked like they had been sitting out for hours (if not days) and it was just nasty, greasy, overall no good. I was afraid to eat some of it for fear of food poisoning so I stuck to dry tortilla chips. They even messed up the mozzarella sticks - how is that possible? They had an extensive beer selection but were 'out' of several of the beers we tried to order. Don't put a million beers on your menu if you can't even keep them stocked! Losers. The ladies bathroom was also gross, toilets overflowing, no toilet paper in any of the stalls and no hand soap. I hope someone with some actual business sense takes this place over, hires a decent chef and makes it into a normal place to hang out...that part of Steinway could use it.",0
"This is the most splendid restaurant...if you don't care about food or money.

Will your out of town friends be totally impressed with your ability to get into a sick looking place last minute on Friday night?  Damn right they will, and the decor of the place is not to be skipped over, its mastered the correct blend of hip meatpacking night club with elements of my grandmother's farmhouse in China.  Modern with vibrant colors, yet its got the same wood work and vases as grandma's house.

The problem with this place is that the food looks beautifully plated and I want to believe it will be just as tasty as it's presented.  But its amazing how they can make such beautiful plates yet manage to suck out all the flavor and replace it with subpar fake chinese takeout restaurant quality flavor.  If they kept the same venue and replaced everything with Panda Express I might have 3 stared the place.

But my biggest gripe was the last time I went with a large group.  The waiter asked if we would like to split the appetizers so that everyone in our group could get a piece.  Who would say no to that?  And what a surprise it was, we got all this extra food!!  Too bad we ended up paying some ridiculous ""extra add on"" fee.  Come on, I thought this was a classy restaurant, not some used car dealership from hell.

TL;DR: 
Everything looks cool, but the menu might have more taste than the food, and you'll be shaken down for money similar to how a crackhead would treat my piggybank.",0
"Not sure what happened to this place. I was a fan. I ordered food from here and my wife got sick. She had to be rushed to the emergency room. I get a call from the emergency room and she says,.........hey, don't eat the food in the kitchen.........What? I just had some............ah man!...... I then find out that the restaurant has a B rating. Skip it.",1
"Yes...I've had food from the Halal Guys. Hubby loves this truck and I don't understand his allegiance. We ordered food after coming off of the  Staten Island Ferry.  Cool, they call tzatziki ""white sauce"", whatever.  Got two dishes, one with freaking lamb (YUCK!!!) and one with chicken. The dishes were odd in that they looked and kinda smelled the same.Also, one set of utensils for both of us.

I elected not to eat. Hubby loved the food however he became ill several hours later. I know food poisoning was NOT an issue here. I just don't get the overall mindset with their trucks.  No true menu's...I just am not a fan.",1
"Normally, I'd give Artichoke something higher than a 1 star review, but after a recent really bad experience there, I can't.  
Late last Saturday night, my friends and I stopped for a slice of pizza there.  Big line, as always.  There was also a lot of unpleasant drama with some douche-bag skipping line and then some girl and guy trying to convince him of what a horrible person he was for doing that (he was directly behind me and didn't budge as far as I could tell).  I'm too old to stand in line with a bunch of drunk idiots, but, we committed to getting a slice ... so, finally, when we get up there, my friend orders 3 slices for us to make it easier for the workers.  Almost immediately, he gives us our margarita slices in a box. In a mad dash to get the f*ck out of there, we rushed away.  We headed for the train before opening the box - lo and behold, we realized that the Artichoke workers hadn't bothered to warm our slices. Seriously, they were ice cold.  
If it wasn't for all the drunk idiots and long line, I would have returned and demanded my money back.  I don't care how busy a place is, there is absolutely NO excuse to serve people who have been waiting in line that long cold pizza. They really should be embarrassed for such poor service. 
I will never return to this overhyped dump.
Honestly, the pizza isn't all that anyway. The artichoke slices are so rich they make you sick.",0
"Ordered the Mac Attack; a bit more soggy/greasy than usual but tasted ok...
30 mins after... in SEVERE pain of DIARRHEA as I'm typing this!",1
There are times in life when you've had a meal at a restaurant and you wonder at which point during that evening you are going to get sick. That's the only way I can describe the experience I had eating here. They give away 25 dollar dinner certificate and no need to wonder why. The salsas are bland and awful (one is made of mayo!!!! Yak!). I ordered the snapper and it was not fresh and had a greasy film. I thought I was going to have food poisoning. My partner ordered the churrasco which was a complete joke- tiny in portion. After closing out our bill the waiter added 17% gratuity since we had a 25 dinner card. Incredible gall of these ppl. The bartender placed two drinks in front of me for the two for one specials. When I asked if he could wait bc maybe I'd wanted to try another flavored Cosmo he said it was policy to serve two simultaneously. Furthermore he told me that he would but the owner would get very angry one him. Te owner is a real douche sitting around counting money. Imbecile. Never again. In fact id be surprised if they last another 6 months.,0
"Is there an option for Zero Stars? This place sucks. In most cases what you pay for, is what you get. Unfortunately thats not the case in this old run down slaughterhouse. Spent $70.00 for ""fresh seafood"" ""skirt steak"" and some other bad offerings. Although service was good, food was like a case of bad diarrhea. Save yourself the disappointment, time, money and bad case of diarrhea and just go elsewhere.",1
"Yesterday we went there for dinner based on five stars reviews. I am very surprised that anyone can give this place five or even four stars. 
The appetizer was ok.  We also ordered veal stew and a duck dish.  The veal stew was tasty but the portion was very small.  It literally contained four small pieces of veal with a lot of fat and four pieces of pure Fat!  The duck breast was also very fat and in addition was overpowered by peppercorns.
The service was fine but the bread arrived together with an appetizer.  I don't understand the point of this.  Every restaurant we went to during the years, the bread is served way before anything else. 

The worth thing is my husband had food poisoning and I did not feel good either.",1
"This is a great, inexpensive izakaya in a cool basement setting. I first tried it on a weeknight early, dining solo, sitting at the bar near the entrance. Had the ebi mayo (tasty), saba shioyaki (cooked perfect), and katsu don (good, but a little on the bland side). Service was quick, friendly and efficient. Best of all - $3 pints of draft Sapporo! Is this NYC? You'd be hard pressed to get Bud Lite at dem prices even in Nebraskee.

I enjoyed my midweek experience enough to bring friends back on a Sunday for dinner. My hungry friends and I impatiently waited until 6PM for opening, killing time in the bland environs of that section of midtown (no, I do not want to go to the top of the Empire State Building, Mr. Shillmeister 1, 2, 3, 4 and the rest of you). Finally the minute arrived and we made our way down the steps only to be greeted with the warning that it's jazz night and it's a bar only. Bummer. 

Hence the docked star. Where is the announcement that on Sunday Mew Izakaya tranforms into a jazz club? There's nothing on their website because there is no website. Their Facebook page mentions music, but nothing about any bar only policy on Sunday. Sign outside just lists hours. 

And who wants to listen to jazz at 6PM anyway? Correction, who wants to listen to jazz anyway? I can understand not seving food while jazz is being performed as it would lead to more projectile vomiting than Mr. Creosote on a Dunkin Donuts binge, but how about some advance warning? Maybe a sign in the restaurant? On the tables? Outside? It could be simple: ""Warning - jazz on Sundays! No dinner service.""

Oh well. At least I wasn't stuck there trying to eat while ""enjoying"" what sounds like someone trying to clean a saxophone with a Siamese cat.",0
"Is the Bronx too hood for yelpers?
You're missing out yelpers AND how can you call yourself a yelper if you don't eat outside your comfort zone. PATHETIC!

Anywho, I believe this is Puerto Rican food...I could be wrong. 

I ate pork mofongo. Honestly, when I heard the name I was disgusted (mofongo sounds like something I would nickname my down there when I was mad at it)
Anywho....mofongo...the food was delish. It's plantain, potatoes and pork rinds all mushed together (i think) I could be making all this up so go research it if you're a real foodie. Anywho it was really good. I'm a sucker for potatoes (starch in general) and then the crunch surprise of the thin pork rinds was a nice surprise. I couldn't eat it all, it's a lot...and it's pretty greasy but it's worth the try. 

Fried plantains are my fave. They sell a good sized container of them for about $3, I think. Such a yummy dessert. Again, lots of grease.

Chicken is BOMB. Their spices make my mouth water and the chicken is ever so tender (and greasy, I think you see a pattern here)

Anywho, we got delivery, that was cool.

I went to the restaurant the next day and the set up is kinda like a buffet/cafeteria. They have the setup and you choose what you want and they serve it for you. Nice little seating area. 

It's right by the 4 train, so you don't have to walk too far into the Bronx if you're scared or too good. 

Oh, yeah I drank a ""morir sonando"" ....Which translates into ""dying dreaming""....Kind of morbid if you ask me....but that's how I do (haha morbidly obese that is!) It's O.J and milk....I could swear I was told not to mix those two together when I was little because I would get diarrhea....Well it tasted good and I didn't get diarrhea from it BUT I will warn you, I drank O.J and Milk afterward at home and the end result was not good for me...that may be that I'm also lactose intolerant but I refuse to acknowledge it. Caridad must have the anti diarrhea secret!

I doubt anyone will try this place but I stand behind it! 

Decent prices too. 

P.S if you happen to be from San Diego (fat chance) and are still debating whether to visit this place or not...Imagine a Puerto Rican version of University Ave. SUPER COCINA and that's what you have here. 

Who dares to venture into undiscovered territory? Anyone?",0
"Came here with a restaurant.com coupon to burn. There was a $100 minimum so we got appetizers, wine, desserts, the whole thing.

The food was good and the waiters very attentive. The carafe of house reisling was so sickly sweet that I couldn't bear it, but I'm not a wine person and that may have just been me realizing I don't care for reisling.

My boyfriend got a french onion soup and spiced sea scallops for appetizers, very fresh and nicely seasoned. I started with escargot, which was plated not in one of those escargot plates with the snails sunken in but with large, pretty shells in a sea of garlic butter, heavenly, and served with french bread to sop up the sauce.

My lamb chops were way too tiny and there was a little too much salad-to-meat ratio on the plate, but no fault with the flavor on either meat or salad; my boyfriend enjoyed his steak frites.

The real star of the meal was the sauteed spinach I ordered as a side (not realizing that my lamb entree would be mostly salad!) What a surprise it was. I don't know what the hell they DID to it, but it was the highlight of the meal for me. Not kidding. Was it the seasoning? I don't know, but it was like heaven. Perfect temperature, like hot buttery silk in my mouth. Yeah, I really really liked the sauteed spinach. Try it.

Dessert was nice but unremarkable. (Warm chocolate cake served a la mode.)

At the end, they asked if it was all right for them to add an 18% gratuity. I'm happy they asked, though sad for them because I 20% when they don't add the gratuity themselves.",0

"As someone who's sitting in sunny California, totally bummed out at the lack of Xi'an in our oh so ethnically diverse city that seems to have just about everything else, I'd like to do you all a public service and encourage you to consume as much as you can.

Yes, you'll probably feel kind of sick from all that grease afterwards. But if you don't stuff yourself with Xi'an while you can, you're gonna regret it. Please someone ship me some.

Also, follow the signs. If they tell you not to sit, don't sit lest you incur the calm, polite wrath of the staff. And once you're able to cop some seats, try not to feel self conscious about those vultures hovering around you, eyeballing you, waiting for you to finish. Just ignore and consume.

Also, what lamb? I didn't even get to that. It's all about the noodles, seriously.",0
"It starts with the reason why you end up here - all the other italian within 3 blocks has an hour plus wait on Saturday night.  So you walk in and sit down. Bad sign. 

Then you r waitress tells you that she's new hasn't had any of the food and doesn't really like pasta.  And you work in an italian restaurant.  Drinks take 25 minutes - to hit the tables - the entire restaurant might have 10 tables in it.  (It is not big or massively busy she is just going to slow she's going backwards)  Calamari app comes out luke warm.  Ravioli entree comes out room temperature - empty drink glasses from rounds long dead left on the table. And then - just went you think you've survived. COFFEE COMES OUT COLD. Not even a tad bit warm.  Ice cold. 

Forget this place - what a total hoax - I had friends in town from SF and I am mortified that we ended up here having such a poor food experience.  And my fiance ended up being sick most of the night from something they served him.",1
"Our recent Dino experience began with waiting on the bartender to finish arguing with her friend / partner / nemesis before she angrily procured our take out order and ended with a night of projectile vomiting during which I relived the waves of black pepper and cayenne pepper that dominated and nearly ruined every overpriced morsel of chicken, pork, beef and macaroni and cheese we ate. The fried green tomatoes were good--at least going down. Not so good coming back up. Egh.",1
"Alrighty. I've never been a burger fan. It just doesn't excite me the idea of a ground meat patty laying in bed between two breads, pour special sauce on it, put the blanket of lettuce and tomato and call it lunch and/dinner.  And be hungry 30 mins later. 

But then I see this undying long lines everytime I passed Madison Square Park and then I learned about this whole world of Burger as a culinary art. It peaked my curiosity,  not my appetite.  so I have been postponing to try this place until my friend dragged me in a bitter cold of November to join the casuality of that long line and the war over tables & chairs. To be honest, the line moves quickly and with patience one can find a table. It ain't starbucks. People will leave after devouring those monsters. 

Ordered Shack Stack (a burger with the meat & the portobello mushroom) so I can taste both worlds. Friend ordered one with bacon and fries with cheese. Verdict: great hangover food - its fatty, salty, fatty, & salty. And I guess NYC must-eat at. Once.

The deep-fried mushroom is crunchy & has a cheese inside. Just imagine my horror:
 Cheese = Salt = poor my kidneys. *jug on water for a week. Nothing special with the Fries & Cheese. Use the $3.25 to add an extra meat patty. The meat is thin and I personally ordered it rare; why no med-rare!!! I'm afraid medium becomes well-done. Overcook meat = hard&dry meat. Not good. Me a lazy chewer. T'was a burger experience. 

And FREEEE WATERRRRRR!!!!

P.S I didn't get sick.",0

"I think I've seen Chinese restaurant bathrooms cleaner than this entire location. I have been eating at authentic, dirty, and questionable-looking Chinese restaurants since I was a little girl, but I am telling you, do not buy into the whole ""this is Chinatown so don't expect it to be clean"" excuse this time, because this place took that excuse and ran TOO far with it. Tourists were looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant and so Jason Wang made this dump--and it worked. You are getting ripped off here and the food isn't anything special. If you still insist on trying Xian famous foods, go to another location, or try this once and tough it through the oncoming food poisoning you're about to experience. I was disappointed with the food, as well as Jason Wang's cash-in by using ""authenticity"" as an excuse to not uphold the quality expected from other crtically-acclaimed restaurants.",0
"My experience: I went here for lunch (2 slices and a coke) first of all it's 1 guy working at around lunch time (maybe his partner called out sick) he looked miserable, it's evident he hated working there. he was throwing shit around.

This place was pretty solid sushi ... Very inexpensive. The spicy tuna is very heavy and loaded with crunchies normally I can eat a few spicy tuna rolls but tonight after that and a specialty roll with spicy tuna I was already getting sick of it.

Their garlic bread and baked potato is amazing! Make sure you say ""YES"" when they ask you if you want onions, lol. The only bad thing I have to say about Tad's is I wish they would do a better job keeping the restaurant clean (bathroom especially!) and get rid of the 'lunch line' you must join to place your order. 

I would never say NO to this place unless one day, god forbid, I get food poisoning or something, lol.",0
"Hong Kong Station is one of the most modern Cantonese restaurants in the entire city, insomuch that it draws on trends in dining in the Pearl River Delta that are happening right now.

The signs are obvious. The décor isn't dragon pastiche or barely-decorated hovel, this is a tribute to Hong Kong's greatest achievement of the late-colonial era - the subway station. The colorful MTR signage and inexpensive white tables represent the keen eye for aesthetics on an Ikea budget that dominates the strips of restaurants on Hong Kong island's south shore. 

The food is also modern, an attempt to bring the Hong Kong noodle soup into the salad bar age. Pick out a number of toppings, noodles and mix-ins, and then are quickly cooked in hot water. The ingredients look pretty sickly placed out on a countertop, which dried out pieces of meat and shriveled bits of tofu. There's nothing particularly dirty, but there's a layer of use that's not present in the dining room era. Perhaps it's best just to order based on pictures. 

Once prepared, however, the result is solid. The chili oil and egg noodles, with added fish balls, would be below average in Hong Kong but here makes the grade. Bonus points for the availability of some stranger ingredients, like organ meat and a variety of seafood balls.",0
"I'm very easy going and open minded. We stopped by thinking it was mexican food. WRONG! Waiter strongly recommended skirt stake something or other. Ugh! The cheese was greasy and tasteless, the corn concoction was nauseating and the worst part?? The price!! $20 for each meal! The idea that they can PRETEND to be some trendy restaurant is sickening. Really, truly one of the worst dining experiences I've had in 10 years. On a positive note, the retried beans were good as was the soda. That's it.",0
"My favorite food is Fish Tacos! And being from Texas, my taste buds lean towards great Mexican food.

I ordered delivery last night, totaling $25 (for just lil ol' me) which included:

- Shrimp Soup 
It was watery, the shrimp was extremely over cooked and unfortunately had a thick dark hair in it which immediately turned me off and made me fearful to consume anything else in my order.

- Baja Street Corn
They just completely go over board with the thick layer of powder which takes away from the simplicity of roasted corn.

- Classic Cali
I was absolutely DISGUSTED!!!!! There was a horrid smell coming from the cod fish, I knew immediately that  the fish had gone bad and I trusted my instincts not to make myself sick with food poisoning.  

- Cabo
I took one bite and regretted it. It was way below par, cold and not seasoned. Terrible! 

I do not understand how this place is still in business. I hope that the next time the city comes in to check the cleanliness of this place that they shut it down.

*I went to bed without dinner that night, it was ridiculous, I paid for spoiled food that was accompanied by a hair.",0
"My first and last time going to this place. I agree with the reviews that the waiters do rush you and give you the check when your at your third plate. The worst part about this experience was I got food poisoning from here. I should have know that cheap seafood isn't the best seafood. However, I just went on a whim thinking that since this buffet is located in sheepshead by other similar establishments they would be up to par. Never again will I come here, bad service bad food.",1
"I woke up from a night out with a deep, deep hunger that needed to be filled and if it didn't i was going to be sick. so i hopped on seamless and found austin's cafe. it looked very promising and i ordered two paninis. They got there in good time, and i was so hungry and desperate that basically anything would have tasted good to me. i teared open the box like a ravenous malnourished bear in the wilderness and shoved one of the pan inis down my throat. at first bite, it was less than good. it was like 6 layers of thickish ham with a slice of cheese, barely melted. i was disappointed. but i ate it anyway. i moved on to the next and it was just unbearable. it was something chicken, but the chicken was ground. when you grind chicken u better do it right cuz if you dont it doesn't sit well and its just a vomit waiting to happen. austins had potential in their pan inis but they were just so gross. never ordering again.",0
"Don't eat here. I'm really sick of walking in without reservations and having to wait because people have found out about this PERFECT little restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. 

The burger is enormous and juicy and is served with duck fat fried chips. You can almost make two meals out of it, but you won't. The beef stew with white beans is a tad thick, but is filled with rosemary and thyme and is a perfect self-contained fall meal. The roasted chicken is herby and juicy. The bread! The onion soup! The Parmesan fries! Get it all, because you really can't go wrong, and it's so good that you'll forget all about your diet.

Now for a few tiny critiques: They serve hot tea but not iced tea and have a very limited drink selection for those of us who don't want booze. Woman can not live on tap water alone. 
And, the kale salad was so overly dressed with a think helping of ""garlic aioli"" dressing that it was inedible. 

But overall, if I could eat here everyday I would.",0
"Congrats, ABP.  You've mastered the secrets of marketing that decorating yourself in warm yellow hues and tints will successfully lure customers in the early parts of the morning through the late parts of the afternoon, especially during a midtown rush.

Despite the fact that some soup containers are found open upon arrival, flies are found in the baked goods, and cashiers are distracted and hardly paying attention to you, the sandwich station looks clean, self-serve eliminates traffic, and the fact that I'd rather come here than downstairs to the Rockefeller Center store, will keep keep me coming back when I'm sick of Pret a Manger across the street.

But something has to be done about the flies and the lack of upkeep in the store.  Please.  

With love, 
Loyal broccoli & cheddar and asiago bread patron.",0
"I think I would have been very happy with my meal had I just stuck with the chicken korma. The only thing I wish is that they would give more rice. They only gave enough rice to fill a tiny takeout box. But the pakora and sag were pretty lackluster which is why my overall rating is lower.

I ordered take out because I wanted to try something different from my standby Fulton Thai. Plus this place has been open for months and I never tried their food.

I ordered the shrimp pakora, the chicken korma and subbed out the naan for saag as part of their 2 course meal deal for $13.95. I wasnt fond of the shrimp pakora-but then again it was my first time having it. Its basically shrimp dipped in egg and then battered in chickpea flour (if you know what that tastes like). But it didnt taste like they seasoned the chickpea flour.

The chicken korma was really tasty and well seasoned. I didnt like the saag at all.  It was very watery spinach and it was slightly oily. Also it had a taste of ginger that was strong which tasted odd and unbalanced in a spinach dish. 

I ordered takeout because I was too sick to cook. I called in at 715pm and my food didnt come until 815pm and only after I called to complain. This is remarkable because I live less than 3 blocks away (dont judge me I told you I was too sick to cook).",0
"Brought my friend here who was visiting from out of town. This was the first time I've ever eaten at a Bareburger, I usually order online. We ordered the apple walnut salad and the panko crusted chicken fingers to start. Let me just say, I don't eat salads and my friend made me order and eat it as it was technically my first salad ever. I did not like the chicken fingers at all, there's no particular reason, I just thought they were gross. 

For burgers, I ordered the original burger with fries and my friend had ordered the lamb burger. For some reason the food here wasn't as good as when I order it online from the East Village location. It was kind of busy and I had to keep looking for our waiter so that we could ask for the check. Later that night my friend started feeling really sick which followed him through the next two days.  The lamb burger was the most recent thing he had eaten that day so we figured it must have been the lamb burger.",1
"I moved to the Bronx this year, and found that this was the most consistently decent diner in the area. I went with my fiancee a few times a month, up until my last experience.

I have a serious nut allergy. This is very common, and most places are very accommodating. I had always ordered breakfast foods until this particular day, when I decided to have the roast turkey. 

Roast turkey. When have you ever ordered roast turkey, and had nuts in it? Of course, I found out the hard way that this particular roast turkey did indeed have walnuts in some sort of stuffing found underneath. I ate a few bites, and immediately I knew I had eaten nuts, because I started to feel sick. I alerted my server, and simply asked for him to take back my turkey and remove it from my check.

The server went to ask his manager for permission to do that. The manager was standing maybe 10 feet away from me, behind a partial dividing wall, and I could clearly see him whispering to my server, and shaking his head, occasionally glancing over at me. The server, of course, came back to me with his manager's ""generous"" offer of reducing the price of my meal to the price of a sandwich, since I had eaten some. Never mind the fact that I'm heading to the hospital upon leaving because they decided it would be a great idea to not inform their customers of NUTS in their TURKEY. I mean, it's not like I ordered pecan pie here.

Anyway, I got the manager's attention myself, and asked him to come over to the table (since he is already watching this transaction like a hawk from 10 feet away, we may as well cut out the middle man). I explained the situation, and the fact that my throat was swelling more by the minute, and that ALL I WANTED was for him to remove that one item from my check. I didn't ask for a free meal; my fiancee had certainly enjoyed her whole meal, and I did have a bialy and some coffee, all of which I intended to pay for.

The manager's response alone is the reason I will never go back to Tibbett Diner in my life:

""Fine, you don't wanna pay, you piece of s***?? Then leave! Get out of my restaurant!""

So, I did. Permanently.

I could never support a business run by someone like that, regardless of how good the food is. Go somewhere else. Anywhere.",0
"Where do I begin

SERVICE: very friendly we were early for lunch and were allowed to have a booth which was very nice because there were only us two. However, on our arrival we doubled the attendance by our entering.

MENU: what you would expect from an americanized pub with the added burgers and toastie sandwiches.

THE PROBLEM:  The food is terrible. The burger was not only a well done on a medium rare order but cold to the touch. It had been sitting around and reheated and was not only cold and well done but tasted Aged and not in a good way. The onion soup was visually unrecognizable as such and upon tasting so salty I cannot remember having such a degree of salt in a dish before the old school cafeteria switch between sugar and salt. Who knows!? I had ordered a special roast Turkey sandwich with cranberry mayo served BLT style. I love fresh roasted turkey and had asked the server if this was indeed fresh roasted. I know I should have known but I had introduced ourselves as locals and first timers really looking forward to the experience. Neither one of us could get by more than one bit. I cannot describe the taste beyond to say we were both expecting to get really sick. So far so good. I hate saying bad things about places but they really need to step back and realize what is going on. So for now buyer beware I'm sure the brews are great.",0
"Wow, are these reviews from the same place I went to on Saturday? 

My first time here. I don't live in NY, I went with my brother and friends who happen to live around the corner. He had a groupon for the place, which seems to be a pretty popular option for Beso. Great groupon btw... 8 tapas!!! We ate like kings and queens! 4 of us in all, enjoyed the sangria! (white) Though we ordered more tapas and another pitcher of the good stuff. 

The food, I thought was insanely good! I usually am not a fan of tapas in general, because I am not the type of girl that likes to share food. LOL But the arepas (Is that how you spell it?) All I know is they were AWESOME!!! Very filling and the flavors were meshed well. 

Service was cool. This place is small, so I always expect that in a small space, a waitress could tell when we needed assistance. We sometimes wouldn't see our waitress for a while... There was a birthday party going on the same night though, so I'm sure they kept her busy. I cant recall the servers name, but I think she did a great job explaining the menu. She was pleasant and even cracked a few jokes with us. 

I would come again. Hopefully for Fri night Karaoke.

***Note to those who read the previous reviews......
-Now, honestly... had I read the reviews prior to going, we wouldn't have gone. At least I know I wouldn't have. (The people in my group were hellbent on using those groupons, understandably so.) In fact, I usually check yelp anytime I go to a new place, so it really must have been meant for me to come here and check them out. I was too tired and hungry to check my app this time around. 
-Give them the benefit of the doubt. The food is really good!
-Looks as if the owner is trying to change the reputation of the place. I can respect that, especially since this is a cute little spot.
-There is a B rating on the door. I know, I know.... but yeah... also was a turnoff for me. I live in MD where our restaurants don't have ratings posted, so when I see anything lower than a A, I panic. Yet, here I am Wednesday after going to this place on Sat with no food poison. lol So.... it's fine guys.",0
"The staff is really friendly and the options are incredible, as well as the prices. 
THE PROBLEM is that, perhaps because they are getting more business than they can handle, they have failed to monitor the safety of their food. 

Two weeks ago, I opened my salad and immediately I sensed a funky smell. When I got closer to the dish, I realizes that their chicken salad was spoiled. I threw the salad out, called them so that they would know to throw it out and stop selling it to others, they said sorry and that I could get my money back (I never got my money back as I figured it was a ONE TIME MISTAKE and really liked the place). 

IT HAPPENED AGAIN today, however. I bought a labeled snack from the fridge that said ""Tuna salad snack"". While the crackers, cheese, and cherry tomatoes in the dish were fine, the ""Tuna salad"" was NOT tuna, it was chicken! I figured I didn't want to waste it, so I proceeded with my meal. A few bites into my salad, I realized the chicken didn't even taste like chicken either, it had a sour/bitter cheese taste to it.  Although I couldn't sense the same foul smell from the previous time I got chicken salad, I confirmed that it was bad chicken by the stomach ache that followed my meal. I called them again to let them know and all they said was ""sorry, bring the container back to exchange it."" 

At this point I'm 100% set on never going back to this place. Some people's diets allow them to eat any fish but not any chicken unless its handled a certain way. What if they ate the ""tuna salad"" not knowing it was chicken? What if you had a stuffy nose and couldn't smell your food and ate it trusting it was fine and then got sick? Although I only suffered a stomach ache and a couple of wasted dollars, I'm pretty sure spoiled meat products and mislabeled food are Food Safety Violations. I mean, people can get seriously ill this way! 

They're plain ""I'm sorry"" without an ""I will check it right away and make sure it gets thrown out"" or ""I hope it didn't make you sick"" or any comment showing concern is a RED FLAG for me as a consumer. It's like they think it's okay, or not a big deal... makes you wonder what else they think is okay or what they let fly in their kitchen -pun intended. 

I hope that this post not only makes patrons of this cafe more cautious about eating here but also prompts the owners/staff/cooks/etc to be a lot more careful with what they are serving people to eat. 

These are very unfortunate series of events, but like they say fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me... I'm already a fool for going back after the first spoiled chicken, this second time will surely keep me (and all my friends) away from this place FOR SURE.",1
"A pleasant experience indeed.

My guy friend and I came here for the first time and was pretty excited as this place has great reviews!
I love ramen and wanted to come here when Ramen King came to town but missed out.
Either way, I knew I had to come for a taste to see what everyone is raving about.

First off, the wait for this place is ridiculously long!  We waited for over an hour before being seated, and this was on a Monday night!  Imagine if we had came on a weekend, whew!
Once seated, we were greeted by our server and beverages quickly came out.
We ordered the Pork Hirata Buns which were DEliciousss.  Amazing flavors, I wanted more!
We also ordered Hirata Chicken Wings.  They were also very tasty but I would take the buns over this any day!  Salivating as I recall the taste :D

As for the ramen, I chose the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while my friend had the Karaka Men.  I love spicy food but was sick so I chose not to have anything spicy.  
I was more than happy with my pick as it was soooo scrumptiously good.  I really love food and this place is probably one of my favorites now.  Although a bit pricy but to me, they were worth every penny...oh and even the long wait! ^_~;

Ippudo, you will be seeing me again :D",0
"OVER RATED!  the look, the smell the vibe.. excellent.. We sat 1 hour late- we made reservation over a month ago, called two weeks ago to make resi 30 min later.. they couldn't and informed us if we didn't show we would be charged 50 bucks a head. so.. after grabbing our first drink at the bar we waited and waited and waited.. then our 2nd drink.. waited and waited and waited.. they bought our drinks at the bar so they did the right thing there, but I noticed this was a standard practice.. everyone was waiting over an hour.. so once we sat-- service was horrible.. we ordered a bottle of wine..we had to serve our self -- do not order the lobster pasta.. lobster something luma- I had food poisoning this am and it def was because of that - veal chop was good. but overall I would never go back until they get there stuff in order.",1
"The food was overall very very good, but the only drawback was that my wife and I both woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. I believe this was from the lamb ribs which tasted a little undercooked, but we were told that the executive chef was in the kitchen at the time so we didn't really question it.  It was too bad because everything else on the tasting menu was fantastic.",1
"The first thing I noticed when going here for lunch was the rap music that was blasting. This isn't a club/bar, it's a restaurant. I won't be going back just so I don't have to listen to that all through my lunch. 

Thai iced tea, probably the best I've had and tom yum soup was decent, but Pad thai was not good, couldn't bring myself to finish it. Lacking in flavor all around.  The worst part was a few minutes after I left this place I felt sick to my stomach for a few hours. Wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"If you're looking for delicious authentic food, a fun belly dancing show, and hookah, all at the same time, THIS IS YOUR PLACE TO GO!

Service: (4/5) our waiter could've been a little more responsive, but still catered to all our needs and very fast too! 

Food: (4/5) delicious and traditional! They have a lot of appetizers that are perfectly portioned to share as well as easy to share (I highly recommend people getting their own entrees of shish kebabs and mushrooms with potatoes, with a side of Greek salad and ""cigars"" for everyone to share!) 

Price: (5/5) you can leave this place happy and full. Your wallet won't be crying after you leave this place as opposed to a night out in the city.

Alcohol: (5/5) So my friends and I have a sick obsession with Zambuka (yes the licorice liquor that you set on fire...) so we decided to go wild since we were having fun and order shots of zambuka for everyone. The bartender came to our table, just for fun (how nice!), and demonstrated a show on how to properly light and drink zambuka. Never have I ever drank zambuka like that, my world was changed after that (mind-blown) 

Overall, come here for a chill night. If you're outside and it gets chilly, you can ask for a ""Halat"" and they'll bring you an epic blanket to toss over. If you're inside, get ready for a show!",0
"I know this place gets a mix of reviews, but hubby and I have been coming here for a few years now and we've never had a bad experience.  I normally order the raw steak pho, but I've also ordered the tofu salad, the appetizer sampler and the lettuce wrap dish.  I service is fast and consistent.  When we go at our usual time, they always remember us and are very friendly.  Bottom line, this is a great spot for consistent and cheap pho, especially if you find yourself in K-town late night, which we often have.  I have a very weak stomach and am very susceptible to food poisoning, but I have NEVER gotten sick here, the countless times I have eaten their food.

I am disappointed in the ambience and the fact that the ladies room has been in the same state of relative disrepair for all the years we've been going.  They can definitely step up their game, but I am giving them a 4 instead of a 3 because they have never let me down!",0
"I am so sick of this place destroying the community. Do we really need a starbuck on every corner? Do we really need sugar water mixed with mild ammounts of caffine? When does the madness end? What does the world realize that small business must thrive in this economy.

The coffee here is drinkable if you enjoy sugared fake milk. I enjoy this just as much as the last person. It was not worth the ten dollars.",0
"I went there for lunch and had their sushi combo and sashimi. Food was OK, nothing extraordinary. 
Unfortunately, I had food poisoning after 5 hours eating here (I'm certain it was not my breakfast as I ate my usual this morning). Beware of this place and avoid at any cost! There are so many better options in the area.",1
"took over an hour for the delivery... I got the chicken parm on Spaghetti... the chicken part was ok, but the pasta was way bland... been feeling sick ever since I ate it (as is my wife), this will be one place we never order from again!  burp!",1
"I have been coming here on and off since the day I turned 21 almost 9 years ago.  
Over the years almost nothing has really changed and I LOVE that!!!  Anytime I want to go somewhere to have a drink and not care about anything but good music (I like country and classic rock) and dancing (floor or bar) I come here!  I don't have to worry about someone taking pictures or messing with me (security would never allow it).  

There are plenty of awful reviews on yelp and I am so sick of the idiocy! So these are my responses to the most annoying:
This bar was NOT created to be based on the movie Coyote Ugly, the movie and then the chain were originally based on here!!!  It isn't going to ""burn down"" ""get closed"" or any of the other things you prisses want to happen because its been here for decades and has a loyal happy base clientele.
If you want to be ""treated with respect and dignity"" and aren't looking for an environment for blue collars to let loose and be intense then don't go in the bar with the multiple bikes parked in front of it!!  I haven't seen a single biker, off duty firefighter, or on leave military man have a problem with the insults and tough love of the bartenders but I've seen plenty of the ""hipsters"" run crying...

If you want to play at being in a rock/country hardass bar but your skin is too thin for the real thing you should stick to the chain bars like CU.  

And for pete's sake stop whining about the stupid cover!!!! $5-$10 is nothing for the city let alone the neighborhood!  Half the clubs charge twice to quadruple that...

Lastly I'll admit that some of the ceiling speakers and things like that are dusty but the main bar (the thing you drink on, the chairs, the bathrooms) isn't dirty at all.  I wear  a lot of white and would know, never got a thing on my cloths.",0
"2.5
Finally made it here.  Was it worth the trek from Manhattan?  Perhaps.  Were some of the dishes really as bad as the (few) worst 1 star reviews said?  Unfortunately, yes.

Eggplant Napoleon looked so good that we ordered two.
Problem was the eggplant pieces were way too deep fried with too many bread crumbs.  I have never had a more heavily fried vegetable.  Couldn't even taste the actual eggplant or the flavor of the baba ghanouge underneath.  The tomato basil type 'salsa' surrounding the dish was pretty good.  Though the flavors just didn't seem to all blend right to me.  Really wish we only had gotten 1 of these dishes.

Lebne - the worst I have ever had.  Thick and creamy but very bitter and sour.  Not really edible.

Hummus- same thing - barely edible and strange flavor.  Should have returned but not good at that.  The worst store brand would be a ton better.

Beet salad- very average.  Pre-made, served ice refrigerator cold.  Said it came with walnuts but there were about 2 half pieces in there.

Brussels sprouts-  these were quite flavorful and good.  Not too oily either even though the menu said they are fried.  

Chicken fatoush -- good thing I ordered this (due to 1 reviewer saying it was the best thing he had).  Perfect blend of mint, spices, cucumbers, very fresh red tomatoes and tender seasoned chicken with perfect small amount of dressing.  Star of the night.

Pita bread served tasted like stale Sahara bread.

Portions are great. Service:  fast and friendly.
Overall it was a fun experience even though half the dishes were a real miss.  I also felt sick the entire next 2 days after eating here. :(
We were too full to try their famed dessert seen on 'best thing I ever ate'.   Good to know they have takeout available right next door.  Wouldn't return for food, but that dessert might be good.",1
"Tried beef rendang, roti canai and kari laksa.

All were good, as mentioned in other reviews. But the portion was smaller than the usual size.

Place is not very clean. And you could find a C on their front door. Now I'm worried, and could image what their kitchen looks like.... I may not come back because I don't want to get sick JUST for sth tasty...",0
"""It's like they have all this food and stuff, and no idea what to do with it"" my friends exact words. It seemed like they just opened the dam place.

Although we were the FIRST to order, it took, what felt like forever, to get our food. Yes, i was keeping track of time but stopped after the 15 minute mark (it was just making me angry). What's worse, the place was unbelievably hot inside. No AC on or anything [EDIT] - I went here in the middle of august btw..

The people helping us were slow and lethargic. It was extremely annoying.
Walking back to work angry, I was hoping the food was going to be delicious. Yep, I was wrong.

My Italian Panini bread was soggy, the chicken was gross (could not even bite through on piece), and the pepper and pesto had little flavor. My onion rings look like the ones you get at a supermarket (because they were).

Wait, the PRICE! Will this place be redeemed??! .... No, everything i got was around $12. I could get a lot more for a lot less.

So why the two (instead of one)? I was fed. I didn't get sick, and i didn't see roaches. So i guess you can say i met my goal of eating successfully. 

Don't go here.",0
"BE AWARE OF DELIVERY. Raw inside of 2pieces of a full chicken.
Ok i know most of the chicken deliveries around here can take from 40mins -1hour around here. You should be expecting fully cooked for a whole chicken that costs over $20. 
I waited approx. 50 mins. I was already starving. Anyhow, I ordered a whole chicken and fries. I finished a piece of leg which was fine. Then started on a breast and as i chewed something felt mushy, and then there i see the red. So already feeling disgusted, i still try another breast but by ripping with hands but this one the outer layer is uncooked slightly kinda pink and opaque. 
So furious called them up and all they can say is we can give u another. I declined due to the fact feeling disgusted, not waiting another hour. Had to fill stomach with fries.
I was really hungry and expected some good chicken. People can make mistakes but this i really hate. 
Pictures will be posted. I will update later if I get sick in a bit.",0
"In Memoriam: 

I moved to Astoria in June of 2012. Little place on 38th between 34th and Broadway. It's a pretty nice neighborhood, with restaurants and bars and street meat and a crack head who carries around  a suitcase and wears Dre Beats. There are so many stray cats. 

When I first moved in, right off of my subway stop (Steinway St.), there was a giant, vacant building on the corner. I'm pretty sure that this used to be a salvation army, as I bought a Shaq jersey there and I never forget where I buy my Shaq jerseys. But, I moved there and there's this hulking mammoth of a space completely open, unknown, like the universe... 

A few months go by. It's probably September. I notice that there are TV's being hung on the inside, a bar is being constructed in the center of this giant windowed mass. I think two things. Strip Club? If only. Sports Bar? More likely. But what was truly built there was more wonderland than bar, more paradise than libation factory, more romantic walk on the beach than over the pants hj. It was Buds, and it's signal was foreshadowed by the large beer tap that glowed blue and true in the olive oil smelling Astoria air. 

For a few weeks it looked like Bud's was going to be opened. I'd pass by every day, but nothing. Then, on a Thursday I believe, the doors were open. The TVs were on. The beer was flowing. The Pearly Gates had been pushed forth and Heaven awaited. Before seeing this I had convinced my girlfriend to go to the lowly Panera around the corner from us, but upon seeing this event, I decided to burn down the Panera. Thankfully I didn't do that because I do rather like their big kid grilled cheese. 

We go expecting the typical fair. Thursday Night football (Ravens vs. Browns yuck) and beer. My girlfriend and I, at the time, were 22 and fresh out of school. We were not the most sophisticated beer drinkers of yet. Walking into Bud's and looking at the menu was like getting a 7th grader a paid subscription to a porn site.  Our hands were shaking. ""21st Prohibition what?"" we said. ""Triple Horse, what's that like?"". ""Stout, Ale, Lager, Amber, oh my."" We didn't actually say the last one. 

Our waitress looked like she was fifteen, which usually is a warning sign, but being an occasional optimist, I decided that this time good things were going to come in small packages. She was in fact not a great server, but I couldn't help but feel that we were sharing something truly special. She got us our beers and we drank them and watched the game. We probably had 4 beers, and it was love. We tipped well, we said thank you, and we were on our way. 

We went back the next day because we're fat fatties. We got more brews in our bellies and also decided to try the wings. Holy ball sacks, I didn't know what wings could taste like...and that has nothing to do with how stuffy my nose can get when drinking! They were great. On more than one occasion the Sun Sauce wings left me reeling from their flavor and sent me to the toilets early and often. Even the diarrhea was just the right amount of spicy. 

For the next year and change we went to Bud's on occasion. Sometimes as much as 4 times a month. We did notice that it had gotten louder, and the crowd more obnoxious and ""suity"", but that didn't matter, Buds was ours. Oh, big shout out to Jacob, who one night stole my heart with his glasses, great service, thankful attitude, and the fact that he looked exactly like me. Also, big ups to the guy who talked to me about my Cactus Jack t-shirt; it made up for the fact you got our order wrong. You were a cool dude. Also, big, big thanks to the man who seemed to seat us every Thursday...you truly were a god among men and the backbone of the establishment and my life. 

So a year passes, November comes. My lady and I are slated to move ( we have mice because we're filthy, filthy people). We get a new place in the ultra hip 30th ave region. We actually are moving today. I go on to Yelp to see if Bud's is being renovated, perhaps being made larger. More tv's? More beers? More handsome and beautiful servers? Nope. It's closed. Closed down forever. I feel like my son died, but worse, because my son was an asshole and Bud's was the greatest. 

Buds, I know you're up there in bar heaven. I take solace in that fact. I don't believe in people heaven, but I do believe in Bar Heaven and Dog Heaven. I hope you're happy up there with your Triple Horses and your Cannonball Sauce, because you deserve it. You made dinner great for my girlfriend and my friends, and I'll speak of you fondly. 

- Love, 
The Guy Who Always Ordered Sun Sauce Wings and Tipped 20% because I'm nice, but let's be real, I'm not that nice.",0
Ordered from this restaurant via seamless. I would have given it a negative rating if I could. I am a sushi lover and not a picky person when it comes to food. Ordered spicy tuna role and the fish smelt like you just brought out of the garbage can.  By no doubt it was the worst sushi I have ever had in my life. I hope we don't get food poisoned.,0
"I came here once the food was good
The second time I came with my sister  , after we got out from this place  she was farting all over she literally kill me .. She got sick from the food we ate she ate the fish broncino whatever you call it .. The bill was too hight 
This place is nice and relaxed for a date or for the family  they just need to check whatever they serving and make sure is good",1
The corn on the cobs was great but the cuban sandwich made me feel a lil sick.  the waitress are definitely a product of Cuba.,1
"Hey joes! You've definitely improved since the last time I came to visit you. Your pork and crab meat buns are top notch and doesn't make me want to die of thirst and msg poisoning.
If only you weren't so cramped and stuffy inside. I dont come here to shanghainese food because lets face it, my parents cooking is definitely preferred but I will be back for the buns!",0
ive been dying to leave a review here. i hate this place! it makes me sick how much the low lifes that work there hate their job. all i ask for is good food and they cant even give me that. every single time their dicks and they get my order wrong and when i let them know they give me an attitude and put less on my next food. the manager's are low lifes and they care less. being that their the only tacobell on this side of the island you have no choice buy to go back. ive tried to call hr but theirs no number to contact them. theirs no way to complain.,0
"I'm not the sort of person who delights in giving bad reviews: Say something nice or nothing at all, and all that. But Symposium merits some special, and choice, commentary. For both my partner and myself, this was the single worst meal we've had in a restaurant in a decade. We were reminded of how food in this country used to be before the foodie revolution. How food was in the UK before their foodie revolution. Greasy, stale, etc. If the vegetables, the peas especially, came from anywhere other than a can, I'd be astonished. They had that leached, institutional-food taste. While the portions were large, what use is that if you don't want to eat 'em?

There's a nice, low-key vibe to the place and the wait staff seemed nice. These are pluses. Also: we didn't get food poisoning.",0
"The food was very good. But it took 40mins to get a table :( 

The tip i would like to give is, know what you order or you are gonna get sick of eatig similar taste of food.",0
"This is a sick donut experience.  Ummm they are intense, these donuts!  As in heavy and sugary and not so refined.  It is hard to find a fresh classic donut. no ""weird"" foodie combos here just sick donuts.  Two bites and I was done!",0
"Portion size great! They don't have outdoor seating, so I parked it in the lot after I ordered drive through. I did get sick after eating there, but I didn't have to clean it up so what do I care?",1
"The worst vegetarian food! Ever. No, come think of it - the worst food ever - vegetarian or carnivorous. 
Every food option looked, tasted and smelled like a bad Chinese takeout that sat in the fridge since last week (which given the disastrous food, most likely was).
For a place that pretends to be vegetarian,  they sure have no respect for plant food. The green beens looked so old and sad, we opted for lo main and quinoa instead. Quinoa was horribly undercooked and stale, while looking lomain was horribly overcooked and stale. Drumsticks were dripping in oil and tasted like tar, while fake chicken was tasteless. 
We decided against their overpriced juices with appetizing names like ""Diahrea"" and ""Constipation "". You are practically guaranteed to experience both if you decide to risk eating the castle food. All they are missing is a drink called ""Vomiting "", which is how you will feel every time you think of this place.
Even vegans would have healthier and more appetizing choices in another castle - the White Castle! 
Given the horrible food, high prices and the fact that the guy behind the counter spoke almost no English,  the place deserves -1 star. But because of yelp limitations and because the place is actually nice looking and a bathroom is clean, a very generous +1 star. 
Btw, while we were there, a couple walked in from the street using another door, and they brought with them takeout from another eatery. Smart! They looked like locals and knew to avoid the castle food. If you think you are smart, you would avoid veggie castle ii like a plague.",0
"Charming with good food but two of us out of seven got very sick. They also rushed us, told us the table was booked after us (? Huh?) and basically shoo'd us out after two hours. This sucked. We wanted to have a long dinner, we had a reservation and everything, wanted to catch up with old friends on a Friday night so getting booted felt bad.",1
"I have to give Jean-Georges a bad review, even tho the food was good and the staff excellent. I had a meal on October 27th that cost me nearly $400 (for two). That night I came down with food poisoning and couldn't eat for a day. 

I considered the food I had that day and realized that the culprit was likely the raw tuna or salmon ""ribbons"" I had, so I sent them a comment through their website, leaving my name, phone number, and email. I did not ask for anything but suggested they consider their preparation of this, actually delicious, dish. 

I don't expect any reimbursement, because they cannot know if I'm lying, but I did expect some response, at least a simple ""We'll redouble our efforts in this area.""

Without that, I have to say, Avoid this place. The expense is great, and if something wrong is discovered after you pay they do not care.",1
"I came here with a brunch deal.. 29 dollars for 2 entree, 2 brunch cocktails, 2 miso soup..

entrees:
- lobster ramen: I can't stop myself from ordering this once I saw ""lobster"" on the menu.. I saw the table next to me had lobster and I was like ""OMG.. such a huge lobster"".. They gave you HUGE lobster.. not the lobster chunk.. like what you will get from a lobster roll.. except that this portion fills me up for a meal.. The soup wasn't like regular miso base.. It tasted really ""creamy"" and ""heavy"".. Seems like the boiled it with lobster.. I like it.. but a little tasteless.. or maybe I was sick, I just can't really taste it?? 
- salmon crepe: My friend love salmon so she ordered the salmon crepe.. It's cute.. but just a small piece of salmon (I think lobster ramen is more worth the order).. and it was ok..

They have interesting cocktails like bloody samurai, yuzu mimosa, FR Sangria.. they don't have sangria that day so we both ordered Yuzu mimosa.. classic cocktail drinks..

service was great and friendly.. it's a cute little spot.. just like ""family"".. they create their own ""recipe""..

CASH or AMEX only!!!",0
"I had such high hopes for this place.  

My 3Q tea - no sugar no ice - came out to be way too much non-dairy creamer and barely any tea.  My friend's regular bubble tea (100% sugar and ice) was the same.  I had to double check the label to make sure i didn't accidentally order a ""milk"" drink, and sure enough it said ""milk TEA"".  

Where is the TEA?!?  It's sick.  Did I really just drink non-dairy creamer with tapioca..  I actually had to throw away most of my drink.

Ok, if you're a casual bubble tea drinker and can't tell the difference, fine.  But everyone else looking for quality, might want to stay away.

I will never ever ever cheat on you again, Coco :(",0
"Sizzler is a perfect example of setting reasonable expectations and not being disappointed. It's a grease pit in Queens where you can go and spend low double digits for steak and shrimp. Are you going to have the best meal of your life? No, probably not. Is the salad bar going to be healthy and organic? Uh uh. Somehow pretty much every surface feels like it has oil on it. 

But the parking lot is tight- because it is PACKED. You will see diverse families of all ages here for a modest meal. The salad bar is a meal in itself and I MAY have eaten five of those delicious, piping hot fried chicken wings. We were beckoned by a nostalgic family member with baller status who rented out the party room. And you know what? We survived, and no one got sick, which is more than I can say for some other places.",0
"why are you so delicious, artichoke pizza?  if you're sick of the usual nyc Ray's pizza iterations, you'll dig artichoke's pizza.    it's super rich and hearty though, so you'll probably only need to eat 1 slice to fill ya up.",0
"One of my only requests of what I wanted to do on my NYC trip was to find a Wafels and Dinges truck, but we found a store instead!!Ever since I saw this place on Eat Street (and realized how sad Toronto food trucks really are!) I knew I needed to try a savoury waffle. 

After stumbling upon a stand which unfortunately had only sweet waffles, we went to explore the store front. It is well laid out with a good menu of both sweet and savoury waffles, as well as drinks and a small store to take home your own waffles. 

The service was prompt, though I'll admit it was a bit casual in that the two staff members working were loudly talking amongst themselves while they made the waffles - but that wasn't a big issue. 

I had the pulled pork waffle and was basically the happiest person in the world. The waffles were crispy outside and soft inside, the pulled pork had a delicious BBQ sauce, and the coleslaw was tangy and really added to the waffle.

The best part of this waffle was that I didn't feel at all sick or ""gross"" after eating it, which greasy food can sometimes do to me. I only felt like I wanted another waffle!",0
"If you're a little tipsy and you get that craving for greasy food at 2am, this is the place to go!! When I was in college and we were just sick of school, we would take a nice walk from Columbus Circle to 53rd Street at 1am, and just eat their delicious food! They are well-known for a reason, I definitely recommend this little cart.",0
"Oh Empanada Mama, I honestly wanted to give you 4 stars.  I truly truly did, but ... well ... I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning shortly after eating here.

On our food-venture through New York, we stopped at Empanada Mama for a snack.  Who am I kidding?  Two empanadas alone could serve as a full on meal for me.  And that's what I had, 2 empanadas.  The Desayuno Columbiano and Viagra were my choices.

The place was so crowded, when a spot opened outside, we decided to bear the cold and take a seat.  They offered us plantain chips and huac in the beginning of our meal.  By the way, it's not free/complimentary.  Something we found out when we got our check.  However, we didn't mind, as the chips and guacamole were actually pretty good.

We received our empanadas in a good amount of time.  The salsa.  My friend, Emily C., and I agreed the green sauce was definitely the best.  I'll take the green over the red sauce any day.  The Desayuno Columbiano was my first choice.  At first bite, I knew I loved it.  The cheese and different flavors just melted in my mouth.  I honestly stated to my friend I wished it would regenerate and create another one so I didn't have to eat the last bite.  But alas, all good things must come to an end.  The Viagra was also really good.  The seafood was excellent, and the sauce that was in it was not too overpowering.  Leaving just taste of everything that was crammed into that empanada.  

It's a small place, so on a busy Saturday afternoon, like we went, it was crowded.  Walk in and write your name on the clipboard.  Then wait patiently.

As I said before, I had to mark it down.  We were pretty sure it was the Viagra empanada, as that is the only one food for the whole day the both of us had, and we both got sick shortly after eating here.

I'll come again though, but probably next time stay away from that one specific empanada.  Maybe then I can rate it higher.",1
"I give it 2 stars because they actually used real wood chips for the bbq here.  However I have to give it such a low rating because 1/3 of my party got food poisoning after.  

Either the banchan or the seafood pancake or the japchae did it in for my friends.  One person even left before any of the bbq came because she was feeling very ill.  So my deduction is that it happened at that point.  We didn't even drink at the restaurant.  

The meats are good and there is someone who cooks it for you.  The food I would totally come here again if people hadn't gotten sick.

Huge disappointment.  Has anyone else gotten sick??",0
"I was SOO HAPPY to stop by this place! I went to brunch beforehand and it so happened that SkyIce Sweet and Savory was only 5 blocks away. They have such unique flavors and I would come back in a heartbeat, despite it's a minimal half hour drive from Queens. 

We ordered the SkyIce Sampler, which was 5 medium scoops of ice cream. Our selections were: Thai Ice Tea (MY FAVORITE), Black Sesame with Seaweed (very extraordinary flavor), White Miso Sliced Almond (It has a very subtle taste to it and you taste more of the almond), Caramel Sea Salt (A little too sweet for me) and Banana Nutella. I also got to try their Honey Ginger (It's a strong ginger flavor with a dash of honey) I would love to drown myself in it if I was sick. 

Service is amazing. We had a candle and they lit it up and placed it over the ice cream to celebrate my friend's birthday. I also wanted to buy a Thai Ice Tea pint home but was afraid it would melt during the drive. They were able to accommodate and got me a frozen one downstairs and they wrapped ice around the container with a plastic bag and then put it in a paper bag for me to go. YOU WILL DEFINITELY SEE ME COMING BACK!",0
"I had many primi-secondi experiences in Roma, which I thought would be the be-all, end-all Italian dining experience of a lifetime. I was up nights lamenting the fact that it would never, ever happen again.

Then I went to Babbo's.

Quick backstory: I was on a supremely regimented nutritional healing regiment for months to tackle some health issues. Issues tackled. I was on a dairy/caffeine/alcohol/nightshade/gluten/meat/spice/spicy/JOY-free diet for many months. They were good months, and mission accomplished.

Once accomplished, I switched my game to ""happy, wholesome"" foods. After so many months, I planned a blowout meal at Babbo with my family. I'd waited years to eat here.

They did NOT disappoint. In fact, it rated one of the top five meals of my life.

Everything. Was. PERFECT. Seriously. My dear father (whom I dragged along on this venture, god bless him) said to me before we ate anything, ""I'm going to get the veal. That's really the tell-all of a restaurant: it's usually dried out.""

Having dined at Mono years prior and seen nirvana in a luncheon (one of the top five, too), I bit my cheek and waited for the food to arrive.

Seriously, everything was to die for. Absolutely. In fact, ambling sideways home with top pants button undone, I floated. I shouldn't have floated. I was so stuffed with the things I'd eschewed for months and in an embibed quantity I've never achieved in a lifetime, I should have rolled. But my SOUL was fed here.

The atmosphere, the service, the food...my GOD, the FOOD...was all phenomenal.

This included a post-meal strawberry basil grappa, which as a former Manhattan mixologist and anti-sweet-hater, I initially was skeptical of, but it was PHENOMENAL. Seriously. (I've said that so many times already I'm sure you no longer believe me. But there aren't any more superlatives left that are adequate for the thing.)

Not only was the beverage incredible, but it, as a digestif, helped me button the pants (lord the pain) and get back home.

I. Am in love. With this food. I don't do it every day, or even every week or month or year or lifetime, but I went for broke on the menu and this is what I had:

Marinated Fresh Sardines with Caramelized Fennel and Lobster Oil  $12:
            You might think three sardines on a plate are not worth $12. You might 
            think sardines are icky. You are thinking wrong. Trancendent. And        
             caramelized fennel? My new boyfriend.

Maccheroni alla Chitarra with Oven Dried Tomatoes, Red Chilies and Bottarga di Muggine  $20
            Let me tell you why you need bottarga in your life: THIS DISH. 

Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads with Sweet and Sour Onions, Duck Bacon and Membrillo Vinaigrette  $29
            I know, I know, great meal and such, I should have no qualms. The
            takeaway: the sweetbreads (thymus gland) were perfectly cooked. It
            is HARD to cook them well. The duck bacon was sick and clever. Fennel
            dust? Not something I'd EVER lose to a cloth and Pledge. It could have,
             pardon me for saying it as I am not Batali, used more sour component,
            and possible more salt. It had four out of five senses engaged. But still
            gorgeous.

Babbo greens and rapini contorni
            I could eat either of these for every meal for the rest of my life. The green
            and bitter components are essential to cutting the fat of the rest of the         
            meal.

Saffron Panna Cotta with Apricot Agrumata and Saffron Shortbread $13
            I AM NOT A SWEET PERSON. THIS WAS THE BEST DESSERT OF MY
            LIFE. The Panna Cotta was perfectly tempuratured and creamy and the
             zing of the apricot and crunch of the shortbread made me wonder why
            I am not a sweet person.

And of course the grappa. A must-do for anyone who ate all the things I just listed (and I tasted my co-diners' food as well: highlight of which were the funghi trifolati and veal. I don't do veal. I was chewing on the bone by the end of the night and I don't do bread and I was sopping up my father's funghi sauce before the main course came).

Everything they do is a delight to the taste buds. It was a true win for the bucket list. Thank you, Mario; thank you. I've been a huge fan before FN and since Molto Mario and I love you. Forever. Thank you.",0
"The brunch at The Strand is tasty, not delicious but very good. However, the service is really really really really really slowwwww. Don't have brunch here if you have any plans to make on time afterwards.

The staff also doesn't listen very well. I asked for a bloody mary and they brought me a bloody ""something"" with bourbon. Then when the waitress came to take it away she asked if I wanted a bloody mary instead. Um...that's what I ordered in the first place!!

They also came and asked to clear my plate when it was half full but left my friend's plate which was completely empty. 

Overall - yummy brunch & sucky f**king service.

Update! After my friends and I left from eating at the Strand we all got SICK! Major diarrhea! !

DONT EAT HERE! WE ALL ATE DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE ALL GOT VERY VERY SICK...ALL NIGHT SICK. IT WAS HORRIBLE.",1
"Initially, I was pretty stoked about this place. It has a really great vibe and the atmosphere seemed lively. Also the prices on the menu were not bad at all. 

However, my experience wasn't the best. Generally, I'm pretty lenient because I come from the hospitality industry. I totally get it. The issues started that people seated way after us were being served and we hadn't even placed our orders yet. Eh...And again I'd be more forgiving if it had been busy. Service was slow and we didn't get our wine until after the sushi was served. 

The sushi itself was pretty good. I ordered a roll of king crab and a monkey roll. Both were excellent. And then, still a little hungry I ordered a california roll. I am sushi fanatic, I am your go-to woman, I will eat! However, upon eating the first couple of pieces of my california roll I noticed it had a watery texture. Needless to say, I didn't finish it and was kind of sad about it. I'm not one to raise a huge fuss. *I was feeling sick about a half hour afterward.*

Overall, this place isn't high on my list sushi places in Park Slope. I might go back to give them another shot, but my expectations are not very high.",1
"Summary: AVOID like the plague

Plus:
The beef with tendon broth is very delicious and flavorful.
The pork filling in the dumplings is delicious

Negatives:
Place is dirty
Service is crazy slow at 2PM Sunday. 45 mins to get our food.
MSG is main ingredient in the soup
The noodle is too doughy.
The dumplings are too doughy.
Dumplings that were suppose to be fried, it's steamed soggy.

My wife and I had food poisoning here. First time and last time coming here.

Prosperity dumplings in Manhattan are less doughy, cheaper, and they serve you within 30 seconds fresh from the pan frier. 

Lanzhou Handmade Noodle in Flushing is not doughy/starchy, very light and flavorful.",1
"Its a cool little bar. Tried the spicy chicken nuggets and the fried chicken and waffle sliders. Both were good. Great beer selection. Overall would be a cool hangout.

God super sick from the night before and had to leave this place abruptly to take an emergency 5 hour nap. Glad to know its not as hard to find a cab around the place.",0
"Can't go wrong with anything here--been here for brunch and dinner, and they're always a smashing time

Everything, from the perfect bistro ambiance, to the tiny glass vases especially made for taking brandy shots out of, to the server chick with sick tatts. Such a hidden gem during brunch hours because you won't have to wait if you arrive before 1pm. For dinner you get seated right away too. Oh but wait, I hadn't even gotten to the food yet!

Brunch: comes with unlimited coffee or tea, and delightful homemade donut holes--they come hot straight out of the oven and are perfectly airy and doughy. Crab cake benedict absolutely melts in your mouth, with perfectly poached eggs, and soft homemade bread underneath. Hollandaise sauce is right on point. Their vegetarian options look solid too

Dinner: they have a rabbit confit seasonally and you must order it if it's available! The goulash is great, as well as the prebanac. Everything is so well thought out--each plate has a great balance of textures, flavors, and the different food groups. Some greens come on the side so you won't even have to worry about not eating healthy!

Oh and if you're really going for a fancy date night, this is perfect, as it's right above The Back Room speakeasy, so you don't have to go far for post-dinner drinks",0
"This place WAS delicious but has went down hill. Attitude is awful from the employees. 
They get No STARS if I can because BAD MEAT smelled bad, tasted bad and made me sick to my stomach.

We gave them many chances to fix this issue but two other times they had bad smelly MEAT delivered.

We never will order from there again! Disgusting I give them a C for Health reasons",1
Crab cakes are too bland and my girlfriend ordered the coconut shrimp and made her sick,1
"Mmm halal! The guys here are so nice and generous. My roommates and I always come here and they hook us up. They give free pita if you ask, even if you got a rice dish. Everything tastes fresh, and I've never felt or gotten sick after eating here. Keep up the good work guys!",0
"great venue and diverse crowd., they keep it real here.  Right nearby Barclays center

looks like the set of TNT nba on thursday.  Went for free concert on Friday, and nice bar, with lots of brooklyn local beers.

Also had sick dj spinning some classics before and after concert.

Would def come back here.",0
"I get a 5 percent discount here and was hungry and sick of the Pace cafe food and had a coupon for a 2 dollar 6 inch sub..only to be rudely told they don't take coupons. Why? What makes you special? Despite the rude workers I got fed, was pleased and probably will come back.",0
"So overhyped.

Compared to In N Out's animal fries, the cheese fries were abysmal, and the shake, a chocolate malt which arrived without the malt, was so thick that I felt sick within 10m.

I know it's a NYC staple, and everyone gets used to their local comfort food establishments, but it was a complete disappointment, sorry.  :(",1
"This novel Jewish delicatessen in the hip neighborhood the East Village sticks out like a sore thumb. Not because it dares to be different and push the boundaries, but because it's one of the only places left in the neighborhood that looks old-school.

I live around the corner from the place, and to be honest, I never had any desire to go here before. But today, I was forced, and it was pretty good. Then again how can you go wrong with $4.00 for four fried Pierogi and sour cream! I want to note that if you don't want fried you can order them boiled. The vegetable soup I ordered was bland, and contained too much cabbage.  

I didn't order the omlettes, but they looked soooo good and only cost $7.00-$9.00! The prices at B&H run from $3.00-$11.00 and the portions are huge!!! (I am so sick of high prices and for small portions). 

Be careful walking into this counter restaurant. The narrow walk way and small tables make it accident prone especially when bowls of soup and plates of poerogies are on top of the tables, and this clientele doesn't look like the understanding type. 

B&H is open from 7 am to 11 pm seven days a week. You can wear whatever you fancy. It's on 2nd ave between 7th and 8th street. Order the Pierogi, have an omlette, oh and eat the in-house baked challah bread. 

Great place to go for a quick breakfast!",0
"Another great burger spot where yet again I went with the burger that featured a fried egg (Texas burger).  Not quite as good as the Black Iron, or as messy, but the wait staff here is a riot.  They have a milkshake called the ""Michael Jackson"" and when we asked ""why that name?"" the waitress said, ""because it's half black, half white.""  Hilarious.  Definitely a dive but a great place to stop after a long day of Beekman beers or 13th Step sports.

I recently went back and felt SUPER sick after eating my burger... so I lowered to a 3.",1
"I don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews for this place. Being a huge fan of L'Artusi, I decided to check out L'Apicio. 

1. Arancini Balls-I love love love arancini, and these had fontina in it, which I also love x 3. These were bland and salted heavily, I think to cover up the blandness--and I think you really have to go out of your way to make a sausage and fontina filling bland. You have to shoot for the bland stars. The description on the menu said there was sage it in, but in fact there were simply really salty, crispy pieces of sage on the side. I am an over-salter, so if it is too much for me, it's probably too much for most people.

2. Lamb Ragu Pappardelle-Good and hearty. 

3. Calamari Ragu - Interesting concept. Loaded with capers, the pasta tasted really fresh, though the calamari was a little fishy (both in smell and quality--I had a touch of food poisoning after this experience, but I'm not docking points for that because hey, it's New York). It was good, but quite tart, so if that's not your thing, don't order it. 

4. Broccoli Rabe side - Delicious.

Overall, everything was good but not great. The ingredients weren't that fresh either.",1
Oh my..well me and my friend were starving but really wanted pizza and hadn't found one that had seats available for blocks. Finally walked in here and thought all was well. He ordered 2 slices and I had one plain cheese slice. Even before we left my stomach started to feel a little bad. Although I had been starving I hadn't eaten finished my one slice. We were then walking around the high line when we both realized we were sick as dogs. Stomach in knots we headed for the bathrooms and will never eat there again. Even the soda was flat.,0
"This review is for the bakery dept.'s custom cakes. 

I have been using stop & shop for cakes for the last six years. Never once disappointed. They are so moist and delicious. I find that traditional bakery cakes are always dry and the icing never tastes good, too sweet etc. 

S&S makes your cake the day if scheduled pick up so it's always fresh as possible. They have icing choices and I always get what us called "" bettercream"". Not buttercream. It is light and very flavorful but not too sickly sweet. They have three cake flavors . Vanilla, chocolate or marble. I've tried the vanilla and chocolate and they are both great, I really can't decide which one I like better. 

They also decorate them so beautifully. I was really surprised that I got this gorgeous cake from a supmarket bakery!   They also have an entire book of characters, occasions, designs to choose from if you like. 

The staff is very pleasant and helpful always!",0
"Uhhhh, HELL YEAH.

When I again fell prey to the combination of my empty fridge and insane hunger, I ordered from here because I figured that raw food would be that much faster.

Though the delivery time said 30-45 minutes, the delivery man was here in under 20 minutes!  Also, he was not rude-- so perhaps I got a different guy.  In fact, he was all smiles!  Score!

Kind of nervous that I must have a container of mercury poisoning and a mishmash of rice, I opened the bag to see that there were three very neat and tidy rolls of very normal size.  I ordered the white tuna roll, the salmon mango roll, and a spicy yellowtail hand roll.  All were just $3.10 each.    

I would highly recommend the spicy yellowtail hand roll.  It was huge and filling, and very flavorful.  My second favorite was the salmon mango roll, which was quite good and had toasted sesame seeds surrounding it.  

The white tuna was just OK.  It wasn't the best white tuna in the world, but it certainly wasn't bad.

I also got the seaweed salad, which was very fresh and just delightful!

The ginger was just OK, and next time I will ask for extra wasabi.  I could not believe my eyes at the price, though.  I was afraid to order $1.00 sushi à la cart, but next time I'll load up on it.  

Nothing smelled fishy and it all tasted good.  I will certainly order sushi delivery from them again.  If I have lots of friends over, we may even opt for a party platter or something.  I was just so impressed.  This was a Seamless win.",0
"Mediocre food (sodium overload) and rude service. A few Chinese restaurants in this neighborhood have closed in the last year or two, so it's slim pickins', but I'm really sick of being scowled at when I asked for extra hot mustard when I pick up my order. It probably costs them a few extra cents after I've paid 15 bucks. Asked for hot sauce today with my order and they said they charge extra for that. Forget it. The only thing this place has going for it is a central location and I guess that's how they manage to stay in business.",0
"I have been to empire biscuit 3 times over its short life. A lot of waiting around for inconstant biscuits:

1. Eat your biscuit immediately because they don't keep well - On a Thursday morning I got a butter and grape jam on country biscuit for me and arugula fennel butter country biscuit for my coworker. No line for ordering and it took between 5 - 10 minutes for me to get 2 fresh out of the oven. Ate mine on the walk to the subway and it was delicious. My coworker was out sick so I ate her's an hour later and it was gross. The biscuit dried out and had no taste.

2. This place cannot handle lines, go for the all butter biscuit - Went with friends on a Saturday morning. Maple butter and fig jam on all butter biscuit was good, I could not taste the maple though. I definitely prefer all butter. My friends highly recommended the sandwich with fried chicken. The iPad and credit went down while we were next up on line. The cashier could not handle it and got very anxious and the kitchen sat idle for 5 minutes as no orders poured it. Once he took our orders by hand we got our food immediately since 8 people had nothing to do. Everybody behind us was pretty screwed waiting in line for what I imagine would be at least 20 minutes.

3. I think they pre bake their biscuits at night and you risk getting the dry tasteless ones - went at 11 PM on a Saturday and got a Kiki and maple, grape both on all butter.  Spent 6 minutes (timed it) in a 3 person but the food came quicker than my first trip. Nothing impressive about these. My roommate had half of each for the first time and agreed they were nothing special. 

I may be back because I live pretty much above the place and it's convenient, but it's nothing to go out of your way for.",0
"When I'm home sick .... All I want is a good matzo ball soup and in the city of New York a good matzo ball soup is not hard to find nor is it more than a seamless web order away. Needless to say I search my seamless web for matzo ball soup and there are a couple diners that pop up as well as friedmans lunch. So.. To my dismay I order the $7 friedmans lunch bowl of chicken matzo ball soup and what arrives 30 min later? Bland soup that tastes like celery... Pure celery and no chicken. There was one piece of shredded chicken and a tiny sliver of chicken SKIN. Here's the best part... The matzo ball tasted like a ball of fresh dill, a dense packed ball of dill... I didn't order anything else to eat so I this is solely based on the matzo ball soup but for $7 you'd think I'd get a saltine cracker or something... Must stick to diners for matzo ball soup!",0
"Came to this place for the first time and had a really great experience. I called to reserve a table for 8 only 30 mins prior to arriving and when we arrived they had a table prepped and ready for us. The jalapeño watermelon margaritas were amazing. We ordered the tacos and the favorite of the table was the carne de res with the mushrooms and cheese. Not something I would typically have gone for but whoa are they good. Our waitress, SARA, was very attentive and made our experience so much better. I have been getting really sick of going to restaurants and having the waitstaff act like they are doing me a favor by doing their job. Sara was seriously the best server I have had in Williamsburg in a long time. 
I give it 4 stars bc I think the food is a little pricey and the portions are pretty small. They also only take reservations for the inside and not the patio. Even with that being said I am sure I will be back to check out their rooftop patio.",0
"I want to like this restaurant, i really do.  And it would have been easier to if the 3 of us didn't develop food poisoning 24 hours after eating there.  Lest you think we're the exception, another friend ate there the night before we did (Saturday 11/16/13) and also got sick.  It may be cheap and tasty, but something is not happening there that should, in terms of cleanliness",1
"I really want to give this place a zero start. Ordered Kea Mao for lunch - while it got here on time but the food really tastes like a bad chinese takeout. (and I mean really bad!!) 

It was just - meh!! Please DO NOT order from this place.. its just not acceptable at all.

As I ate a few fork-fulls of my cheap non-thai food, regretting my decision to order it.. and just waiting to get sick..  gag!",0
"The old standby, sure thing, my bottom b*tch. Essex is a no-brainer when it comes to Sunday Funday kickoff brunch spots. The food is yummy, the price point is perfect and the staff is friendly.Will never get sick of it!",0
"While there are so many dumpling places and dumplings are so easy to make at home, it's very hard to rate the ""best dumplings"". For some people, the best dumplings are made by their grandmothers! However, this tiny dumpling place does have something special to offer. The price is very affordable: 4 huge pork chive potstickers for $1. ($1 pizza sounds less attractive now.) 10 boiled dumplings for $2.5. The filling is a bit small for a huge dumpling like that. The dumpling wrapper is very well made - it's moderate thick, smooth and delightfully chewy. The panfried dumplings are crispy on the outside and juicy inside. 

I saw them cutting a huge pie into pieces (@$2.5). The sizzling cutting sound tingles my every taste bud. Unfortunately I was always full on dumplings. I don't like the sour & spicy soup. The soup base was weak and the ingredients were not enough, but $1.25 for a small one. I feel thankful that they didn't put the potstickers directly from the pan into the styrofoam boxes. The hot potstickers always burn holes in the styrofoam, another form of food poisoning. Not enough dumplings on site, I carried a bag of 50 pieces of frozen dumplings home tonight.",0
"Their Pizza sucked!!! It was so nasty, gave me and my friends  food poisoning. The cheese was expired, and it was pricey for one plain pie. It was not FRESH,DELICIOUS or HOT !
Please don't waste your time here. before we not it they have rats dying in the same over we get ate our pizza from. Not over exaggerating, I hope this helped you. You can get better pizza and for cheaper. Oh and they are rude.",1
"Went here with a friend on Wednesday night and enjoyed happy hour margaritas. They tasted gray and were not watered down. On the other hand, we both got a mild case of food poisoning from the spinach dip. We also ordered pot stickers, which were ok, but nothing amazing.Overall, will be back for the drinks, but will skip the apps.",1
This place absolutely nasty. I have seen bath room cleaner then this place. My friend worked here and show me pic of the kitchen an i nearly threw up. I here that they let the burgers turn gray and the stakes. Once i went there an i went to use the bathroom while i was waiting on my food an found a condom in the toilette. The food is also nasty it made me sick. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN,1
"My favorite NYC restaurant. Had my birthday dinner with friends here years ago and I still think about the tomato soup everytime I get sick. Great place for a solo lunch, mid-week dinner date, or dinner with friends. They have seating for larger groups which is soooo great for visiting friends or occasions. Not too expensive and great affordable wine list! The barbera was my favorite.

Not all restaurants are loved for being incredible, but for the sentiments that you attach to them. The downside was always the service. They are kinda rude. The menu isn't exceptional. But I never had a bad time here even waiting on a check for what seemed like forever.",0
"So what it's a tourist trap. 
They have some damn good bakery items. Well known for their macarons...and not your fake coconut ones you can get anywhere. These are authentic ones. We tried 2 flavors. PBJ (out of this world) and Pumpkin (very good but disappointed we didn't go for something else). They were soft and a bit chewy but with a melt in your mouth feel. I also tried their upscale Ho-Ho's (no comments please). It was sick. Fresh devils food, cream, hardened chocolate...yum! 
Prices are high as you would expect being next to Rockerfeller Center. 
Long lines but they move quickly. Limited window seating. Oh and you can grab a pre-made sandwich or a soup as well (didn't try either). ENJOY!",0
bacon cream cheese that got my wife and I sick as dogs for 36 hours.  have not returned since...obviously.,1
I ordered Rosa Mexicano for delivery a few weeks back. Let me tell you- WHAT A MISTAKE. I have never in my life been so sick. It was very clear hours after eating it I had gotten food poisoning. This is the second time I have had Rosa Mexicana and both times I was incredibly unhappy.,1
"Place was packed but managed to get an outdoor table in the back.  Good ambience, service was great considering.  Honestly I was sick and wasn't really able to taste the food but it looked great and dinner mate was very happy with it.",0
"What can I say about this Williamsburg Mexican restaurant that hasn't been said about Kazakhstan already
 
Its Dirty, Smells, the food is horrible, and I got sick when I got home.
 
The staff much like the people of Kazakhstan are depressed and odd, however have a glimmer of hope in their eyes of possible escape.
 
The kitchen looks like a Kazak prison only not as clean.",1
"Bone-in Burger. Foie Gras Gnocchi. That should give you an idea that you are in for a different kind of steakhouse experience.

The latest M. Wells joint is just as bizarre and amazing as their previous ones, and this place is a definite must try.

Don't let the run-down exterior and the shady L.I.C. neighborhood fool you - once you step inside, behold a really beautiful and very nice dining room, with an open kitchen and raw bar and some really funky decor. We were seated next to what looked like it could have been a shelf in my mother's house, with some weird knick-knacks and glassware on display.

The service here is perfect, and just what you would expect from a nice steakhouse. From the moment you are seated, you are treated right. We were greeted promptly with some delicious warm Pretzel Rolls served in a little sack. This was some excellent complimentary bread - super soft and pillowy and enough to make you ask for some more.

One of the really fun parts of the meal here is the presentation of the food. Everything looks really nice in addition to tasting great. We ordered a ton of food, which was mostly amazing:

- M. Wells Caesar ($12)
This is an impressive-looking plate of salad, with a ton of cheese covering the deliciously crunchy croutons and lettuce. It's fairly standard-tasting caesar salad, which is not a bad thing, and is a nice, lighter refreshing way to start the meal.

- Onion & Bone Marrow Soup ($14)
This is a great take on French Onion Soup, with a giant bone filled with marrow stuck in the middle of the bowl. Here's where it starts getting overwhelming, but this was really delicious too.

- Bone-in Burger ($15)
This seems to be the thing everyone is talking about, and the thing to get here. It is as bizarre as it sounds - a burger with a giant bone sticking out of it. It's a mess to eat, even once you manage to get the bone out of it. It's kind of like a steak on a bun, since the meat is made of a mix of different high quality and delicious meats. This burger really is incredible and is worth all of the hype you are hearing about or will soon hear about it. It's not just a novelty and something you get just to Instagram a picture of, it really is excellent. 

- Grass-fed Cowboy Steak ($50)
This is a really delicious steak, but that price tag hurts a bit. It was super buttery and flavorful, but had quite a bit of fat and not quite enough meat for me.

- Dill Carrots ($10)
This was the one thing I didn't really particularly like. $10 for a bunch of carrots swimming in oil. Not that great. I should have just gone with instinct and got more carbs instead of trying to add some silly vegetables to the mix.

- Poutine ($10)
I also don't really get poutine yet. I've tried it a number of times, and I always wonder why I do it, when after I enjoy a few crispy, not completely soggy and saturated fries, I pretty much get sick of it. Some of the cheese curds were also completely raw, which I don't know if it was the intention, but I didn't quite enjoy. Maybe go with the regular fries next time.

- Cinnamon Cake ($11) a la mode (+ $3)
Dessert is pretty great here. The pastry chef comes around with a dessert cart after you make your selection from a large number of cakes and other options. I kept seeing stuff about this cake, so I figured I should try it, and it did not disappoint. It's not very rich, which is what most people like about it, but I kind of wish I tried the richer sounding Black Forest Cake, since I enjoy sweetness to the point of diabetes. This was really great though, and is a nice choice to end the meal after the overwhelming meat sweats start to set in.

This place is out there, both in concept and location, but I am a fan. It is pricey like you would also expect from a nice steakhouse, but the very unique and different options make it a must try. I would love to return once they introduce some new menu items and to try some more of the delicious cakes.",0
"Although I have ordered from them many times (only because i am in midtown and it is the only kosher Chinese around) .....I WILL NOT BE DOING SO ANYMORE !!!! 

Dine In - Food is prepared earlier and reheated --No way they could make my order in under 2 minutes .... 

Delivery -- Always arrives cold no matter how explicitly i request it to come hot ..... To top it all off ... my last 3 deliveries all took over an HOUR AND A HALF to arrive ... when i called the place to ask were my food is the lady on the phone immediately got defensive and started blabbing about how they are busy and its not their fault ....A SINGLE ORDER SHOULDN'T TAKE AN HOUR AND A HALF!!! 

Not to mention that my last order i got food poisoning .... so therefor ... I will never eat eden wok again ...

PS I work on 8th and 34th .... 10 minute walk ....3 minute bike ride....",1
"This restaurant food is terrible , I been there two or three times, always make me feel bad sick after breakfast. I will not recommend anyone to come this restaurant again.",1
"Gave me mild food poisoning or severe indigestion which gave me bad headaches and nausea. I ordered a chili con carne here at 7PM on 11/19/13. It took 10 minutes to prepare, so I figured they were preparing it fresh instead of scooping it from a pot sitting there all day. I ordered it to go in between classes and when I got to class, I saw it was black beans not red beans. It was also extremely thick. It was too peppery as well. Seeing as I was just coming from work and would be in class til well after 9PM, I ate it. I ate it slowly too, so it was not shoveled down my throat. No more than an hour later, I began to get severe headaches and nausea. I toughed out class and felt weak and tired. I ended up puking my guts out and feeling cold and clammy. The headaches continued due to severe dehydration. I will never ever go here again. It was a horrible experience. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I have never gotten sick the way I did from eating here. I know it was the chili because that was all I ate all day and that was all that came out  of me when I was puking.",1
"I came here last night on a date with my man...and I was very excited to eat some steak!!!  I left sick and hungry.  

Let me start with the positives:
- Frango Ipanema.  Chicken with passion fruit sauce.  YUMMMM.  Cooked perfectly.  Very flavorful (This is the only reason I've given 2 stars) and warm enough.
- I love the decor and how they have used the space
- Great seat by the window
- Nice music that wasn't too loud
- Plantain chips brought to table were yummy
- Red wine (plus one on the house for below steak incident)
- Herb fries were good, but a little undercooked

Now for the negatives:
- The steak!  :(  I ordered the skirt steak, at the waiter's recommendation and I asked for med/rare-rare.  It came out well done and cold.  I sent it back and asked for rare.  What I got was RAW and cold.  I couldn't bring myself to send it back again (Or eat it).  The potatoes and asparagus that it came with were also not hot or cooked enough.  I just figured I would go home and cook it properly....that didn't happen.  This $22 steak became cat and dog food.
- Pao de queijo - mushy, bland, and overall bad
- The ginger ale.  It tasted like seltzer w/ a hint o' ginger ale.  The worst I've ever had.
- The way my tummy felt last night and tonight.  That was my only food yesterday, but i could not eat when i got home last night.  and i can't eat again now.
- It took forever to get the bill.  Our babysitter called and wanted us to come, but getting the check took about 15 minutes.

I was going to go with 2 stars, but now reading over these negatives again, I'm bumping it down to 1.  I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"This place was a pleasant surprise in the neighborhood!  We came on a Sunday night and the place was great, busy but not too loud.  The fried calamari was the best I have had in a long time: Crispy and really fresh tasting (even though Sunday isn't the freshest day to order seafood in a restaurant).  The branzino was delicious and the sides complimented it perfectly. The shrimp scampi had a really delicious flavor without being too oily, you could taste the wine and butter but didnt' feel sick afterwards.  The cocktails are pretty delicious too, you can't go wrong with any of their drinks. It would be great for a girls' night out or family outing.  My only complaint is that the portions were on the smaller side for my big appetite, but hey, this is New York!  Oh, the waitress we had was really friendly and wonderful. Thank you for a great overall experience.",0
"I really wanted to give this place a positive review because I'm a huge fan of mom-and-pop establishments, but I can't. It was pretty bad, even by cheap-Chinese-food standards. The main problem is that, although the portion sizes were generous, there was very little meat. My pepper steak with onions was mostly onions, with only a few pieces of small, fatty, chewy meat. Where's the beef? My sweet and sour pork (yes, I ordered two meals - one for that day, one for the next) was mostly just deep-fried flour and cornstarch. A couple of pieces didn't contain any pork at all. Also, my pork fried rice (which came with each entree) was mostly fried rice, with just a few tiny pieces of pork. (At least, I think it was pork.)

I found each meal surprisingly soggy, and the sweet and sour sauce tasted like pure vinegar. (Perhaps they just added red food coloring?) I felt kind of sick after eating the sweet and sour pork. Also, the delivery person lingered at the door for a tip, which was a bit awkward/uncomfortable since I had already put a 20% tip on the credit card. (I used the restaurant's online ordering service.)

Now that I've covered the negatives, let's get to the positives: The portion sizes were big, the prices were fantastic (five bucks for an entree, pork fried rice and egg drop soup? Can't beat that!), and the food arrived hot and fairly quickly. These positives simply don't make up for the problems discussed above, and if you're looking for quick Chinese food, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. Hopefully the restaurant is able to resolve these problems (maybe they were swamped? Maybe they were having an off day?), because I'd really like to give them a second chance.",0
"It was a misty September evening in Manhattan as I sat in the plush back seat of a town car, lulled by the sounds of the windshield wipers moving steadily like a metronome. I exited the cab and ducked into Betony, narrowly escaping the rain.
I was the first one to arrive, nearly 20 minutes early. After checking in with the hostess, I sat at the bar and took a look at my surroundings. Ornate carvings adorned the walls, motifs stretched across the vast ceiling.
***
Jack, the jovial bartender with an Australian accent, nudged me and asked if ""gin and I got along"".
I was intrigued. ""Why?"" I asked.
""Well there was a mix-up with another order and we have an extra Negroni..."" he winked.
 
***
The Negroni washed down delicious bar snacks. Thin, crispy Cabot cheddar crackers and salted bread crumbs.
 
I felt a tap on my shoulder as Sharon was the next to arrive. After ordering a delicious Palma Fizz (vodka, ginger, lime, rosewater ), we were led to our table upstairs and given the menu.
 
The menu begins with appetizers on the left, small plates in the middle and then larger entrees on the right.
 
Frank arrived and the three of us decided to order the following appetizers: foie gras bonbons, fried pickles, and chickpea panisse.
 
Michelle was the last to arrive, as a shutdown of the E train caused a 1.5 hr delay. Since we couldn't get a hold of her via phone, text, email for over an hour, we had no idea what happened to her. The atmosphere prickled with nervous anxiety, the fear of the unknown palpable. After a quick prayer, a deluge of Michelle's texts flooded our phones to our relief. To their credit, Betony's servers were patient and periodically checked up on us to make sure everything was ok.
 
With our party seated at 11pm for the 9pm resi, we hungrily devoured the foie gras bonbons which were flashed with liquid nitrogen and covered in candied cashews and crusted with black pepper. Fantastic. The fried pickles with peppers packed a little heat which cooled off with the yogurt.
 
Our server, Daniel, who used to be a sommelier at The NoMad, presented a dish, compliments of the kitchen. He knew that we were worried sick about Michelle and wanted us to enjoy our dinner. Heirloom tomato gazpacho (zebra tomatoes are green even when ripe) with frozen goat cheese sorbet showcased familiar flavors with unconventional preparation.
 
The chickpea panisse tasted like a crispy spring roll with a puree of chickpea inside. The savory ham went well with the creamy chickpea.
 
When we split the bread apart, billowing wisps of steam gave us a mini-facial. I almost dropped the bread on the floor because it burned my fingers. We immediately spread the butter on the bread and watched it melt into a small puddle. Great crust and a burst of anise-licorice essence from the caraway seeds.
 
The seared foie gras dish is a must-order. Sour collard greens, crispy kale, smooth foie with ham hock and ham consommé. Tip: With your leftover bread, sop up the last drop.
 
While we waited for our entrees, we talked about our careers. I'm always curious to hear the different work environments of my friends - to hear what works and what can be improved to increase efficiency. Frank and Sharon, both in finance, have been friends for a very long time and she still has no idea what he does for a living. (He is a product manager for mobile applications at a financial services firm). Pretty soon, the focus shifted to my job. When one asks what I do, there are many answers. Suffice it to say that I wear many hats as my firm of 50 people can be described as entrepreneurial by nature, a perfect conduit for me to take on disparate responsibilities and segue in and out of different verticals. The lack of red tape and micromanaging allows me to focus energies on the tasks at hand instead of worrying about politics and face time with senior management. As long as you get the work done, that's all that matters.
 
The plates of short ribs cut our conversation short. This dish deserves all the hype. The application of beef fat throughout the process has yielded the best short rib I have ever tasted. The fried sweetbreads provided crunch and the charred romaine helped cut through the fat.
 
I almost forgot about the second entree that I ordered, a glistening chicken roasted with chanterelles and Tokyo turnips. The perfectly crisped skin served as a protective shield for the chunk of meat as its drippings naturally mixed with the fragrant pool of chanterelles.
 
I let the hostess know ahead of time to prepare something special for Frank and Michelle to celebrate their recent engagement. Champagne foam with strawberry sorbet and pannacotta with lemon ""caviar"" (comprised of an agar and lemon reduction). The hot mixture gets plunged into a cold bath which forms small sacs that look like caviar.

"3.5 Stars

This is hard for me to actually break down.  The thing is that I am a HUGE fan of mac and cheese.  And I do make it homemade, which I enjoy more than any of SMAC's...which is why its hard for me to be omg this is amazing.

I had the Pariessiene, which was delicious but I kind of got sick of the taste after about 1/3 of the major much size.  So I kept it for left overs and totally didn't enjoy it later.

I have also ordered catering from there of just the all american, and it was delicious  and everyone at our event totally loved it.

It is order at the counter and then they bring it to your table.

ALl in all--I would cater from them if I didn't have time to coko myself, but I would not eat there again unless someone else wanted to pay for me (essentially not worth the $$ or calories)",0
"I want to give this place 4-5 stars because the food is typically good. But the reason for my rating is what TAKES AWAY from the overall dining experience.

I usually order the chicken pho if I dine alone. Otherwise, with friends we do the whole Shabu-Shabu thing and it's quite fun. In any case, it's definitely not a formal place... paper napkins and disposable chopsticks, etc.

My PERSONAL experience 2 weeks ago was that I ordered the Large Chicken Pho and about 3/4 into it, I found a piece of hair about an inch to an inch and a half long. Needless to say it was repulsive and I felt sick to my stomach. I tend to not overreact over things like this - people make mistakes - I called the waitress over and she offered me a new one. I was basically not hungry anymore anyway so I said no thank you. She said she would ""adjust the price"" which meant ""not paying"". So I left without having to pay (I wouldnt have even if they asked) and I havent gone back since. 

I have been coming here for years and I would definitely recommend it for the food (I never had an experience like this prior) but it was not a pleasant dining hour for me the last time I went.",0
"Cozy looking spot, with its couch-like seats and earth tone walls.  I got the pineapple fried rice with sunflower seeds & soy protein.  I liked eating it with the avocado, but after eating half of it, I got too sick of it.  I think vegetarian dishes are just not for me, though I did like the pineapple!",0
"The pictures posted on Yelp are very deceiving...

What I wish I had known
- Very small sitting space
- Awkward table set-up with old benches and stools
- General lack of hygiene (marks on my spoons and plates. Yikes.)
- Cash only, and you order/pay at the register 

Makana is set up to be a mainly take-out restaurant. Yes, food is cheap, but for what you are getting, you will be paying more for future medical problems. 

My ""106 Deluxe"" - 6 pieces of sushi or sashimi with a roll fell flat. (What was I thinking ordering sushi from this sketchy looking place, anyways). BUT I did not get sick afterwards, so I deem this adventure mildly successful.",0
I live a few blocks away and been going here for years.  Years ago it was great now there has been times where I have gotten sick,1
"I tried their lunch deal a couple of months ago. I really disliked how they reheat the food in Styrofoam bowls. The food was still room temperature by the time it was served. The food tasted okay, but we did get sick later that evening. That's what we get for food reheated in the microwave for a few seconds. I'd rather eat at Raja Sweets which doesn't appear to be as clean, but at least none of us got sick and the food was HOT!

The mango lassi was pretty tasty but it came in such a small cup. I would've need at least 3-4 of them.",1
Not sure what on earth has happened here but its not good. Seemingly overnight several of the wonderful long time staff are gone and the whole vibe of the place has changed. No longer the place that I've grown to love and where I've gone religiously for the last several years.The coffee has gone back to being inconsistent - generally dependent on who is making it. And when its bad it borders on undrinkable. The food has also gone downhill and the salads which I used to have multiple times a week have made me feel sick the last several times I've had them. It seems that someone made some really bad decisions. Truly a shame.,1
"Staff were excellent however I was served under cooked fish, chicken and greasy rice. Send dish back. Pretty much same dish came back out. Ordered a breadstick. Breadstick was raw dough on the inside. Paid and left. Within an hour developed mild food poisoning. Eat out a lot in NYC. I have never had such a bad meal. Never again. I consider this review a public health warning for others considering eating there. Totally unacceptable. Great drink specials though, I hear. So glad I didn't order the $20 steak. I was only ripped off for $14 instead.",0
"I love coming to the Green Market. You can't find produce like this anywhere for the price. Everything i farm fresh and delicious. The farmers and vendors are very nice and are always ready to answer any questions or offer any samples needed. 

I can wander around this place and never get sick of the smells, food, or flowers covering every inch.",0
"Sometime later on in the evening we would have went to watch a friend of a friend perform. We went to two other places by in hopes that we would grab a quick bite to eat. We ended up coming back here when the two others were packed and no room to even squeeze in another party of five even in the midst of crowds. We realized, holy damn! We should've came here in the first place. 

Sports bar with large TV screens everywhere. (It doesn't matter where you sit -- you'll have a good view.) The place was clean and food wasn't the best I've had in bars, but a lot better than other sports bars I've been to. We had a sample platter, sliders, and nacho dips. The platter came with 7 spring rolls (my boss counted bc he loves spring rolls), nicely sized chicken strips, calamari, wings, and one more thing I think? Food did not disappoint at all. The sliders were juicy and tasty as they were--didn't even need to add condiments to spice it up. 

Our waitress was Elizabeth and she did an awesome job with the 6 of us. Quick speedy service, great demeanor, great customer service, went along with our shenanigans when we were joking around, and had such great memory of what our drinks were. She came around every now and then and would just ask ""do you want another [insert drink name]"" without asking you to repeat what you ordered 20 minutes ago. This girl deserves a raise for her excellent service skills. Not just because she remembered our drinks but her entire service with us was great. 

Only downside to this place is that it is way too loud at the bar. You scream and still can't hear each other.

What we really came for was the band. Who knew there was a live alternative rock band playing somewhere on 2nd ave? Kudos to the band for an awesome time.  Great song covers and surely got the crowd going with those familiar tunes. Though I wish they rocked out Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit instead of mashing it with Nirvana's other songs. 

So.... All you bands out there.. This is a great place to rock out. You get a wonderful crowd, good food, and a sick location in Manhattan to do so. 

Good times spent here and will return.",0
"Warning! If you don't want to spend 2 days with food poisoning, avoid this truck.  Had the cheesesteak special on Tuesday Nov 19th and was sick for 2 days and almost ended up in the hospital from severe dehydration!  Wonder if anyone else got sick from eating from them on that day but my coworker and I had the same lunch and experienced the exact same results.  Not good at all",1
"ZERO STARS!  

UNACCEPTABLE!

This meal was disgusting!  Honestly, I would have gotten a better meal if I were to drink clam chowder right out of a fisherman's old rain boot (after he's stuck his foot in it).  Yeah, that's how bad it was!

This restaurant makes me feel terrible.  First of all, I spent $30 on my meal and ended up throwing a good portion of it in the trash, just like the net amount listed on my paycheck.  I work so hard to earn my money and the government comes in and throws a good portion of it in the trash.  What I am left with is small, insignificant, and sad.  In addition to being a waste of money, it has been about 40 minutes since I finished eating.  My stomach is making all sorts of growls and rumblings and I really feel like I swallowed a bunch of rocks.  I would not be surprised if I wake up tomorrow morning with food poisoning.  Where is the New York Department of Health when you need them?

The quality of the food was so poor.  I ordered fried tofu, tomago, and the beef teriyaki entree with salad.  

I started with the salad.  I ended up picking out some rotten lettuce bits and one piece of bird seed (I have a budgie, so I know what bird seed looks like, and by golly, that was a bird seed in my salad - and no - my budgie did not throw it there when I wasn't looking).  The salad was as unwashed as a cheap and haggard hooker.  It tasted no different than if I went outside and started eating the dirt out of my neighbor's garden.  The ginger dressing was runny and watery...it didn't stick to a single piece of salad.  I ate about 80% of the salad and then I couldn't stomach eating anymore.

Next I ate the tomago.  Well, I ate exactly one bite of the tomago.  Instead of tasting like the delicious egg custard I was expecting, it takes like fish scales that had been scraped off the fish and thrown away two days ago.  Barf!

Since I was quickly forming a guilt complex from throwing away food I just shelled good money out for, I decided to go ahead and try the beef teriyaki.  I opened the container and was in disbelief.  What sat in that container was the nastiest, fattiest piece of leather ever.  I ate two pieces and had to stop.  It was turning to wood in my throat and choking me.  It was then that I noticed that the meat had a green tinge to it!  It was rotten!  I wouldn't have known from the taste of it because my taste buds had already been assaulted with dirt salad and fish scale custard!  So there was more food thrown away.  

Lastly, I tried the fried tofu.  So gross.  It was basically chunks of tofu covered in a soggy, chewy material (I cannot claim this to be any sort of breading...it was muck).  This rubbery, soggy sheath held in at least a half tablespoon of bitter cooking grease that the tofu was more than happy to absorb.  Imagine eating cold McDonald's French fries that just soaked in the fry vats for about 24 hours, in oil that hasn't been cleaned or replaced in at least a month. Mmmmmm...sounds so appetizing, doesn't it?

It's such a disservice when restaurants charge hard working people so much money (my dinner totaled $30) and serve them nothing but crapola that essentially wasn't even fit for safe consumption. 

SHAME ON YOU, NOUVELLE!

Not good.  Got sick from the chicken and it is overpriced.  Do not recommend it.,1

The grilled chicken with tequila sauce is outstanding as well as the fried chuleta with tamarindo sauce. I had the cecina (salted steak cut thin and grilled) but would not recommend it. It didnt taste fresh.  I didnt get sick from it, but there was just something not right with it. Overall mostly good.  One exception is the so called tres leches cake for dessert. Although some variation is to be expected region to region, this cake was not even a distant third cousin of tres leches.  Stick with their homemade flan for dessert.

Subject: Getting DIARRHEA from your restaurant

Dear Madam/Sir:

After getting sick several times from another take-out Chinese restaurant in the community I decided to try your restaurant instead.

I've included the menu that came with my order though I've removed my contact information.

I ordered a large Won-Ton soup, two eggrolls, Singapore Chow Mai Fun and Moo-Shu Chicken and upon delivery I ate some of everything and I got DIARRHEA; don't shake your head or go into denial-mode; I GOT DIARRHEA.

The next day I finished the left-over Singapore Chow Mai fun and didn't get sick at all so obviously the problem has to be somewhere in the other three dishes.

Obviously, from the number of people in your place I'm not the only one that feels this way; most customers will not bother confronting you with their getting sick, they'll just stop coming to your business.

If I still get sick, I will then no longer patronize your restaurant, it's really that simple.

I don't care that you get to post an ""A"" in your window and, by the way, I'm not necessarily going to complain about your place to the local health authorities but I am telling YOU but to be honest, complaining to the local health department will still be an option that will remain on the table.

I do not get sick in my own kitchen so it is obvious that you're doing something very wrong in running your restaurant; if you don't know proper food handling procedures then I suggest you go into another business.
 
One last thing; you may be doing everything right but there could be one employee that is deliberately sabotaging your efforts; if this might be so then get rid of this person; he's obviously wrecking your business.

Sincerely yours
""A Friend In The Community""",1
"BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING AND ROTTEN MEAT!!!
My family have been regulars at Mel's ever since it opened -- we found the burgers excellent, drinks good and fine service. But we have now had two scary experiences that have made us flee the place for good. First, a few weeks ago we ran into some good friends eating with their young kids at Mel's -- also regulars. But after eating a burger their 6 year old son wound up in the hospital with severe food poisoning, had to be re-hydrated with an I/V. This scared us a little, because Mel's was the only possible cause (aside from the burger, everything else he had eaten was shared by the family and no one else got sick). But we thought, well, something like that can happen anywhere, it's just a fluke and we love the place. So tonight, we went back. I ordered my usual, a Cadillac burger. The minute I bit into it I almost spit it back into my plate. The meat was rotten. The smell was so strong I almost threw up. I have NEVER sent back a burger in my life, or any other dish for that matter. I asked my husband to smell it and he was revolted as well. We immediately sent it back. Our waitress handled the situation well, but the manager did not even come over to the table to apologize and we left the restaurant determined never to return. Beware, because it is clear that despite the apparently good quality of the ingredients Mel's does not follow good food safety practices and you can get sick or be disgusted by your hamburger. So sad, because we loved the place but we definitely will never go back after these experiences!",0
I got food poisoning over the weekend from their shrimp pad thai. Never ordering from here again.,1
"Is this place under new ownership? It's now terrible! I ordered a few times since my review last year and noticed that the quality had gone down and decided to order one last time over the weekend. This last order was downright abhorrent.  The boneless spare ribs were almost pure fat and we're actually ice cold.  The sauce must've been a new recipe because it tasted like hot and sour sauce, not the usual flavors you expect from the ribs. I also ordered shrimp dumplings which they were out of and substituted pork dumplings instead. Fine. Except they literally tasted like rancid meat.  I couldn't eat them nor did I want to for fear of getting sick. I just got over a cold so I'd rather not wreak havoc on my recovering system with rancid meat. Lastly, I ordered a shrimp spring roll and received a shrimp egg roll. Again, fine. But it was reeeeeepulsive. I took one bite and was overcome with the flavor of old, stinky cabbage and freezer burnt egg roll wrapper. 

I really used to like this place and in a matter of one year I loathe it. 

Toodles, SI Panda.",0
"Yo: this place is a tourist trap! 

(If you're a tourist, just do it.  You don't really have a choice.  I understand, and I'll forgive you one day.  And besides, if you weren't packed in here with all 17 of your friends celebrating someone's 32nd birthday, I wouldn't be able to call this place a tourist trap.  So... thank you?) 

The most popular menu item is a ""goblet.""  There is a whole look of goblets, which are basically ice, sugar, candy, juice, and probably a shot of some fruit-flavored liquor.  One of those drinks that's fun to instagram but will just fill you up and make you sick without getting you even tipsy.

Of course, there were a lot of birthday parties going on... this place would be great if you are celebrating something that needs a gimmick.

My friend and I each had one martini -- we came when Sugar Factory was new and we like to stay on top of the Meatpacking scene.  I had the Reese's, which was rimmed with peanut butter and actually tasted like a Reese's.  I was pleased.  Her drink was the Chocolate Covered Strawberry.  She found it so sweet she had to water it down to drink it.

We had our drinks and then got the heck out of there.  The tables were so uncomfortably close together I was practically eating the fries of the guy next to me.  Glad to have visited, but I won't be back.",0
"BEWARE:  Unclean and Unsafe COOKING PRACTICE!  The worst diner experience of my life.  The waiter rushed my party and other tables around us to order our food.  The waiter asked specifically what type of milk or creamer we need for our coffee and failed to deliver.  He forgot to put butter on my friends toasts.  My omelette was under cooked and after all the other mistakes I went to the counter to complain.  The manager said he will take care of it.  they just slapped the same omelette back in the grill and gave it to me burnt and half the potatoes were gone.  I didn't even touch/eat any of the food prior.  I had to send it back again.  I will never eat here again... I will tell everyone not to eat here cuz it's just plain awful!!  BelAire Diner why did u slap the same omelette back on the grill?  Why didn't you make me a new one?  I don't think it's very Sanitary to put food that was served on someone else's table and attempt to cook it again on the same grill w/ other patrons food?  BelAire Diner, how do you know I'm not sick?  Or have some crazy disease?  Have you practiced this before when other patrons send back food?  SHAME ON YOU!!!",0
"I really hate to bash this place, since it's new but I had a really bad experience here. My friends and I came here for a quick bite to eat and the service was so slow. Lots of people have been complaining about the service. We had to wait so long to order, to get an extra bowl or spoon, and then to order dessert, and get our check. Our quick lunch ended up being much longer than we thought. The food came really fast though, which should worry you. 

The menu is very limited, which surprised us all. I'm no ramen expert, but I have eaten my fair share of ramen bowls and this place was sub par. I got the Shitake Mushroom Ramen with a soft boiled egg and char-siu pork. Let me just say the noodles in my bowl were all bunched up together instead of being separate, so there was a big wad of noodles in my bowl. The noodles were a tad overcooked too. Then, the mushrooms were boiled and flavorful, but they were also kind of tough. The pork was just gross, it was all fat and no meat. I don't know about you all, but when I order pork I expect some meat with some fat. This was all pure fat. The egg was cold! The flavor of the broth was pretty good though. Ultimately I didn't finish my bowl, and since we had to wait for our check our bowls of soup were sitting there getting cold. 

Our soups started to form a greasy film or skin on top form the fat, which I thought was just gross. Both me and my friend got sick after eating here. This was not a good experience, and I will not be coming back.",1
"I had the hamburger for $3.60; the bun was greasy, with little flavor.  The thin, weird looking meat patty was greasy too.  I also had  a hot chocolate for $3.50 and the cup was only 2/3 full.  I felt a bit sick after my meal.  
I would have been just as happy going to the Burger King next door and the starbucks across the street.",1
"Seems like we were just very unlucky last night with our experience here.  

First I'll start with the good: cute, romantic, incredible cocktails (bisous and soleil are amazing), yummy fries, decent service and delicious desserts (ile flottante and creme brulee were great).  this is a great drink/dessert place, but I say skip dinner entirely.

Which leads me to the bad: 

the escargots with bone marrow is disgusting!  I like bone marrow, and I like escargots, but they both just tasted BAD last night - the snails were particularly ""dirty"" in the way they tasted, and very gritty.  And the bone marrow, well, I can only guess it was melted down and a very minute amount mixed with the escargots because I didn't see or taste anything close to bone marrow aside from an oily bit at the bottom.  I don't know what possessed me to keep eating it - I didn't like it at all, but kept giving it a try over and over until it was gone.

the croquettes are just bad - they're tiny little pre-frozen tater-tot looking things that did nothing but burn my mouth.

the mussels - oh my god, the mussels!  I felt so bad my husband ordered these - 1/3 were not even open indicating that they were bad, and another 1/3 were RAW!  yes, raw.  no doubt about it.  this was the only dish we complained about and were thrown a free creme brulee at the end of the meal, but you've just got to wonder about a restaurant when you are served under cooked mussels.

the ""risotto"" was not at all risotto.  it wasn't even a little creamy, cheesy or tender, just a bowl of rice mixed with roasted peppers, mushrooms and saffron.  my friend had a few bites and just left the rest, this is where I felt absolutely terrible for recommending the place.  the poor girl went hungry.

and finally, the ugly:

as we walked home, I started feeling nauseous... we got home around 11:30pm, I woke up at 2am completely sick at both ends and have been in bed all day today with body aches and a fever.  

to be fair, I'm hesitant to call it food poisoning because it's a very nasty thing to just blame a restaurant for - also nobody else from my party got sick and I was around a pukey kid a few days ago so it could have just been a stomach bug, but regardless, this is the type of experience that just ruins any thought of ever going back there.  bleh.",1
"My friend had his birthday party here last night and it was quite the debacherous experience.  

I won't add much to this review that hasn't been covered by others. For approximately $42 (with included tax and tip) you get two hours of all you can eat sushi (and they were serving up to 3 rolls at once),salad,soup and bottomless pitchers of sake and beer. 

The atmosphere is very fratty. It's I want to get wasted before 11 PM, which was quite well accomplished by many of the patrons. Girls stumbling around, check. Said girls vomiting in bathroom, check. Lots of banging on tables as sloppy sake bombs are triggered, check check and check! 

Then why on earth am I giving this place 4 stars..Because you have to know what you're getting yourself into and I thought the service was very good. The waitress was attentive to our large party  and even provided us with plates and knives to cut some birthday cake which we brought. 

The sushi was not as bad as you'd expect for AYCE. I particularly enjoyed the spicy tuna! 

So if you're under 25 or like us wanted to act like it for a night.. for a unique birthday experience, look no further.

p.s
Don't wear anything here you don't want to get covered in sake and beer!",0
"I don't know why the great reviews for this place.  Everything is overly oily. The only tasty part of our meal are the complimentary breads, which were unfortunately soaked in olive oil as well.
I had the octopus appetizer and the scallop entree.  Both seafood dish were not fresh tasting.  There were some fishy smell and made me have violent diarrhea right after the meal.  The scallop were $28 for 4 pieces.  The califlowers were so burnt, they were bitter and uneatable.  The octopus appetizer was soaked in oil or butter and overly salty.
We were there on a weekday, and there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.  She was definitely overworked and forgot my drink order.  We still gave her a 20%tip since it wasn't her fault the meal tasted bad.
Won't return again.",1
"For the crime of wanting a decent meal before flying across the country, my husband and I are paying with a day of nausea. I don't know who Todd English is, but I assume he's some large-headed celebrity chef, because normal chefs don't feel the need to put their name on the food or to ruin perfectly simple, classic meals with a bunch of unnecessary nonsense.

Husband had a burger, which he said was good, but not great. It came with a pile of fries that looked wonderful, but were soggy and oversalted. The only crispy part of the fries was the random pile of black herbs sitting *under* the fries. The herbs were also salty. The burger came served on a brioche, which, apparently, justifies its hilarious price tag. Now, I know that airport food can cost twice as much as food in another location, but even at half the price, it would have been a ripoff. 

The portabella quesadilla was just a travesty, start to finish. A quesadilla is such a classically easy dish, it really takes a celebrity chef to screw it up. How? Well, you could put four different cold salsas on top of it, along with a massive pile of cold onions and a wholly unnecessary mess of cold, slimy cilantro, so that food that is meant to be hot and crispy is cold and soggy after the fourth bite. The corn salsa was sweet, which might have been OK on its own, but made no sense with the other flavors. The salsa fresca was tasteless, comprised of mealy tomatoes. The avocado crema was just confusing and didn't go with anything else. It's pretty much thin green sour cream. I'm not sure what the additional oily green mess smeared all over everything was supposed to add. 

As for the portabellas, they were homeopathic-grade, i.e. scarcely detectable. I pulled the quesadilla apart just to confirm their microscopic presence. The interior of the dish contained far more red onions than mushrooms, which made the giant pile of onions on top really seem like overkill. By that time, the cheese was a sad, congealed mess and the tortilla was simply wet. 

This meal cost $40! It was maybe worth 9. But at Todd English, you will pay $9 to add some chicken to your already ridiculously overpriced salad. An order of chips and salsa costs $8. Note to Todd English: chips and salsa should be free, on the table, when you sit down. If your cost for chips and salsa is more than 50 cents a serving, you need to sue your suppliers. And if you you legitimately think you should be making a profit of $7.50 on chips and salsa, your customers should be suing you. Class action lawsuit, anyone?

We should have known what we were getting into when we noticed that each table was stocked with 3 bottles of water: plain, Fiji, and Pellegrino. No doubt if you so much as touch them, you'll be charged, probably at a 600% markup.

Anyway, now we're both sick to our stomachs, and we have an entire day of travel ahead of us.",1
"Bland, tasteless Mexican.  Go anywhere else for your Mexican fix

Came here to pick up a burrito and some tacos and brought it home.  Opened the package to find a bunch of toppings piled inside of a folded-over tortilla, not exactly a burrito.  No flavor, no taste, no heat, just there.

She got tacos - same exact poor construction, same exact complete lack of taste.

There's not much to say when we ate 4 bites combined.  At least we didn't get sick, or even eat enough to get sick.",0

"Exactly what I expected when my friends said we were going to get noodles in Chinatown.  Food is pretty solid and didn't make anyone sick (something to consider elsewhere).  We were a pretty easy crowd and they met our needs with good food and ample beer.  Given the excess of food we ordered, price was very reasonable.  It has its purpose and accomplishes it well.",0

"Went to Dram Shop a couple weeks ago (it was just starting to get chilly) and made a note in my phone that read ""Dram Shop bad"" so been meaning to write this review for a while.
Why did I make such a note? Well my friend and I were driving around Park Slope looking to try a new bar and stopped in here. We ordered the nachos - just something to munch on while we chatted over beers. My friend actually got sick from the food and I had the McGurgles as I call them but thankfully didn't get sick.
As if that wasn't bad enough, I clearly remember having to flag down the bartender, Matt, on several occasions for plastic forks to eat the nachos, for a napkin, and lastly for the check. Was it busy that night? Nope, he was busy texting and ignoring customers. I could see that being okay if you had a bar full or regulars but new customers who are trying to engage you and you just completely ignore them? Bad form.
Cherry on top was that my beer was warm...WARM BEER!",0
"Biggest complaint: they don't care about allergies. I ask for tofu on my bagels because I have a very severe dairy allergy, and this is one of a few places that has tofu spread.  Unfortunately, the people that work there either put cream cheese on my bagels because they're not paying attention, or (as I've been told many times) the person putting the tofu and cream cheese in the containers that go in the cases mixes them up and labels them incorrectly.

This wouldn't be such an issue if they weren't essentially poisoning me every time I get a bagel.  I'd suggest that you watch them make your food or check everything carefully before you leave, because they often confuse orders.

Also, the bagels are often overcooked/completely burned.  I get an attitude from the employees when I ask for new bagels because I literally can't bite into them.  

I also have an issue with the way their system works.  Often, when I place an order, which is always for just a bagel (no wraps, sandwiches, etc.), I'm directed to the registers to pay.  Then the person who took my order and will be preparing my food will also take the order of the next person in line, which is usually more complicated, and my order has to wait to be made.  This has happened several times, and is incredibly frustrating.

These have been recurring issues I've experienced over the last 6 months. I usually go in here at least twice a week, so these are not isolated incidents.  Also, I've contacted the owners through their website, and haven't received any responses.",0
"My first time here I ordered the poached eggs with spinach. I got food poisoning. I gave it a 2nd chance yesterday because it's SO convenient to my laundromat, but I steered clear of the dangers of undercooked eggs. I ordered the ""Challah French toast.""

When you use the word ""challah"" on a menu it suggests thick, fluffy bread. The French toast bread was no more than 1 centimeter thick. The egg batter created a hard, dry egg crust around the edges of the bread. The fresh fruit was bruised and wilted, and the maple syrup must've been sitting out for awhile because it had the consistency of hot glue-gun glue. I ate 3 bites then left. 

Just awful food.",1

"I've gone to a lot of juice shops and I always rate them compared to Liquiteria.  I have yet to find a place anywhere with so many options that are actually delicious!

The Killer XX may have actually saved me from getting sick the other day!

This place may just make me swear off coffee since I'm in the neighborhood again!",0
"I don't know what it is, but I wasn't as wow'ed as everyone else was/is! Maybe I'm just a true Organic Avenue lover, but Liquiteria is just not my cup of juice. 

Granted, they have a wide variety of juices and other things like food, snacks, packaged goods, and even fresh, made on the spot, cold-pressed juices and smoothies; versus OA which only offers bottled beverages and food. 

This place is very vibrantly colored and decorated. Definitely the most lively colored juice bar! 

As for the juice itself, it's delicious, and large. I was surprised that a sickly shade of brown that I was drinking was surprisingly sweet (and yummy for that matter). It definitely will fill you up quite nicely. 

One thing that does irk me is that their bottled beverages don't have nutritious facts. C'mon at least include the ingredients.",0
"If this isn't proof that Vietnamese food need an SOS in NYC, I don't know what is. The taste was below average.

I felt sick.",1
"Went to this place as consolation for the wifey after making the trek to SOHO and  discovering that the new Kate Spade Saturday store a couple doors down was still under construction.

The cafe is in a touristy part of Manhattan so the odds are that you wont specifically go to Spring street unless you're a tourist or work there.

We didn't have as bad an experience as the prior reviewers but it's not stellar.

Service - Was greeted and seated immediately upon entering. Service is basic but cordial. We got the items we asked for shortly after ordering. It's NYC with people of varying linguistic abilities so don't expect the wait staff to be overly chatty like at a down home diner. 

Ambience - The decor is charming in its own way. The walls are painted with the Mediterranean dry sponge treatment that was all the rage some years ago. I'd want to shoot a scene here if I was an indie no budget guerilla movie maker. 

Food - The coffee was ok and the food is ok but we didnt order anything fancy. Their interpretation of cannoli has a firmer filling than what I expected ricotta to be like. It's was almost like hard cream cheese. The slice of orange peel gives it a nice tang.  I gotta say it, the cannoli from Rizzo's pizza delivery in Astoria tastes better  We didn't get sick nor feel any negative after effects so that's definitely a plus in the cafe's favor.

It was a Monday afternoon and there were at most three other tables that were occupied. We were there for an hour but did not feel any pressure from the wait staff to either order more or to eat and go. Oddly though, the waiter decided to automatically tack on an 18% gratuity to the bill. I did not find their SSID and did not bother to ask if there was wifi as I was using my AT&T mobile.

Restrooms in NYC are difficult to find so any available facility is good and deserves mention. This one has character and it's better than restrooms at a rock concert.

"So, I'll start by saying that the service is terrible here. You have to enter Casa Mezcal with lower than average expectations in this regard. We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night and were told that it would be a 45 minute wait. No worries - we expected that. The hostess took my phone number, told me she would text me when our table was ready and pointed us in the direction of the suuuper cool bar that just opened downstairs (I'll get to that later). One hour later, my boyfriend went to check on our reservation. When he told her our name and explained to her that she took my number, she looked at him stupefied and told him that she didn't remember that happening......um........

Thankfully, we were a few delicious spicy margaritas deep at that point, so we didn't mind too much when they seated us 15 minutes later at a small bar counter against the kitchen. Rewind to the part where we had a few drinks downstairs in Casa Mezcal's new bar. SO awesome. Dim lighting, attentive bartenders and a cool, loungey vibe. Highly recommend the spicy margarita. 

When we finally got to our (bar counter) table, we ordered the chips & guacamole and the chicken tamales. Both were amazing. I definitely want to go back to try the enchiladas as those also looked delicious. Thank God for the sick new bar and good food / drinks combo....it made us forget about the poor service.",0
"They deserve every terrible review written. I am very sick and made an order of chicken noodle soup among other things.

I tried to pay via credit card - they dont accept credit card via the phone. I had a hundred dollar bill - the woman said that would be fine & that the delivery man would bring change. 

He didnt bring change - gave me insane attitude when I said that I was not willing to let him leave with the money and bring it back later (Order was $17.)

He stormed away with the food - I called the restaurant back & they did NOTHING.",0
"This place!!
I've been getting sick of the sushi places in Murray Hill and am usually too lazy to travel elsewhere to get sushi, but last weekend, the boy and I decided to travel a little further uptown and try Matsu.

I gotta say, it wasn't just the rave reviews on here that made my decision to try it. It was the photo of the toilet seat. I just had to see it for myself. This is how immature I am. Also, someone's picture of the Spicy Tuna Salsa roll basically sold it.

Regardless! This place is awesome. Pretty cozy, not a huge amount of seating.. I'd say maybe 20 tables tops. We went around 8 pm on a Saturday, thinking it was going to be packed like the other sushi places by us, but it wasn't, thankfully. There were a good amount of full tables when we got there but nothing crazy. We were sat immediately and also helped immediately, which was awesome. 

We ordered edamame and some wine and I ordered the Spicy Tuna Salsa roll (spicy tuna, mango, peanuts,...possibly avocado?, wrapped in rice and seaweed and then fried in tempura topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce...holy YUM). I also got a crunchy spicy salmon roll. There were only 6 pieces to the hand roll, which was a little disappointing because I feel like usually there's 8, but I ate enough edamame to make up for it. 

The service was great. It took a little longer to make the rolls that I thought it would but it was nice to just sit and relax and enjoy the company without feeling like we were being rushed out of the restaurant. The ambience was nice, too. Not too bright, not too dark. I'll definitely be coming back here again, it was awesome.

And you gotta see that toilet seat.",0
"Come here if you want food poisoning! Because that's what I got!

I came here for dim sum. We ordered the beef tripe. It tasted wrong. Other people at my table felt the same way about it. We asked the waiter to take it back. He took it off our card and said ""These are internal organs. If you're not used to internal organs you shouldn't order it."" That left us very confused. Shouldn't order it because it you know you're serving spoiled food? Or shouldn't order it because we're not used to eating spoiled food? I don't get it. I know what beef tripe tastes like. It doesn't taste like that. Maybe you shouldn't serve that dish at all. Just saying.

The other dim sum was ok. I usually judge dim sum based on how good the shu mai is. Theirs was meh. I've also had dinner here in the past. It's ok. Nothing memorable.

I will say that the space is very nice. Much nicer than most Chinese restaurants. It's just sad because I really like the decor (and their bathroom is really nice unlike most Chinese places) but I really can't trust their dim sum anymore.",1
"Came here once with a friend and everything was fine. Came back a second time to try their uni pasta and got food poisoning. Unfortunately, the risk of getting food poisoning again is preventing me from coming back.",1
Upside down slice was possibly the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. The sauce was so sweet it was sickening.,1
"Beer selection is the only thing going for this place. I've been 3 times with my girlfriend hoping it improves. The first time was their second night open, so I'm willing to forgive the chaotic service that time, but it's only gotten worse since then. They have dozens of servers and bus boys but they all seem clueless.

The ""nacho fiesta"" was a watery bowl of bean dip and watery pico. 

My $21 steak burrito was so greasy I felt sick from eating it. It was basically just a doughy tortilla filled with beef stir fry. And I was spitting out chunks of charred solid meat. I should have sent it back, but I had already decided never to come back.

My girlfriend's chicken torta was bland and forgettable, but at least it was only $13.

I understand that they are trying to provide beer food and the real attraction is the admittedly impressive draught list, but the food quality is really unacceptable. 

There are better bars and better restaurants in the neighborhood.",1
I normally buy lunch there since I work in the area.  Today I got physically sick when I bought their cream of broccoli soup.  Took my first two spoons then got disgusted. They were a bit too organic with over 20 bugs in my soup. I called them back immediately telling them what happened and was put on hold.  I had to call back to speak to the manager and I told him that he should remove the soup.  Went back after work and the soup was still there almost empty and again more bugs when I checked.  I was appalled.  I will never go back there just the though of eating bugs is making me sick as I type.  I would have normally given them 4 stars but today just killed it for me.,1
"I sent one of my usual and quite anonymous ""Diarrhea Letters"" to this place and obviously the management paid attention to it because I've since ordered in from here twice and everything's been absolutely fine, thank goodness.

Sometimes people just need a little bit of a ""heads up"" to get them back on track.",0
"I had dinner at Aquagrill with a good friend this past Tuesday night.  It was my second time at the restaurant.  My first time was on a Saturday night with 3 friends, and the place was too packed and loud for my taste.  It is a popular restaurant, and deserves to be, but a low-key Tuesday night experience was more to my liking.

First, the service was second to none.  Alex, the manager, brought us two glasses of champagne and a pumpkin pie desert on the house.  She was very friendly, professional and genuinely wanted us to have a great experience.  What surprised me was that she didn't seem pressed for time.  We chatted with her for quite a while and enjoyed the conversation.  She came by our table just enough to check up on how we were doing, but not too much that we felt interrupted.  One thing I find annoying in restaurants is when a staff member asks you, right after you've taken a bite of food, ""how's everything?"" ... and you feel rushed to chew and swallow and answer them.  Alex came by several times and chatted with us, but never were we in that awkward situation. There was a natural and easy flow to the service all night.  

Our waiter, who looked like a young Charlie Sheen -- and we told him that and had a laugh about it (he'd been told this many times before) -- was really cool too.  Easy going, professional and just a good guy.  The best service is when it's natural, and that's what Alex and Charlie Sheen were all night.  Bad service is when they're trying too hard and it becomes annoying, or when they pay so little attention to you that you end up spending a lot of time looking for them.  

After discussing the menu with Alex, my friend and I both decided on the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass.  This is just an incredible dish!  The balance of flavors and textures and colors is ... in a word ... perfection.  We were both blown away, and I could see myself coming back over and over and ordering this dish until I got sick of it.  Then I'd explore the rest of the menu.  

I had mine with a side of Soft Truffle Polenta, which was amazing as well.  Alex suggested this side to me.  I had overlooked it because ""polenta"" doesn't exactly sound exciting.  But she said the truffle in it makes it great, and she was right.  It was a unique and delicious side dish that went perfectly with the Sea Bass.

My friend is Russian, so we ordered two shots of vodka with dinner.  They generously brought us double shots.  Russians do shots in between each course to boost up the appetite, and it really works.  I was sold on vodka shots with dinner, and was glad we didn't bother with wine or beer.  

For desert, we ordered a chocolate cake with walnuts and vanilla ice cream on top that was divine.  Divine!  Like I said, Alex brought us a free pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top.  It was also really good, and a nice Thanksgiving-time desert.

Overall, Aquagrill did a superb job on food and service, and I enjoyed sitting in the enclosed patio looking out at Sixth Avenue.  Just a great dinner experience!  

I'd highly recommend the more chill Tuesday night Aquagrill experience.  I'd say the restaurant was 80% full.  Perfect, in my mind.

I feel like I found a hidden secret in NYC:  Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Soft Truffle Polenta and the Chocolate Walnut Cake at Aquagrill on a Tuesday night.  Oh, yeah, and with vodka shots (Russian style). 

Shhhh!   Keep it to yourself, or Tuesdays will soon turn into Saturdays.  ;)",0
"This one is much closer to me than the one on Continental Avenue between Queens Boulevard and Austin Street; this one doesn't even deserve one star because I got the runs here from the tuna.

That, and on a half footlong I asked for one extra scoop of tuna which was not forthcoming; they didn't know how to ring this up not that this matters because I won't be going there anymore, that is unless I write them one of my ""diarrhea letters"" first.

I can also understand the other complaints about this place; they're all not so unreasonable; the people at the other store are way more professional.",1
My husband got food poison here. Terrible costumer service .,1
"My boyfriend and I were super excited to go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant since we always watch his personal shows on youtube. We went on thanksgiving so the 5 course meal was $115 per person without tax so we were expecting something a little special. But boy were we disappointed. 
The food was unique but it wasn't amazing. It was so creamy that it made our stomachs sick. By the time the entrees came out we did not want to eat anymore. But to our surprise even the entrees were sickening our stomachs. It's really weird how the steak was very well cooked and seasoned but something about it turned our stomachs. We barely ate half of everything. Bottom line, IT IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GO TO A NICE RESTAURANT FOR A DATE, DON'T GO HERE. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED (unless you like super creamy and oily-feeling(?) food)
HIGHLY RECOMMEND PER SE OR JEAN GEORGES if you don't mind paying a little more for a better experience.",1
Do not go here! A friend and I have had violent food poisoning after visiting Barkogi and ordering the chicken strips on 11/27 and are in the process of of alerting the Public Health Department.,1
"We had dinner at Trois Canards on a Saturday night. The food was only ok. Both my husband and I had fish and we both had the praline soufflee. I also had soup which was SO salty I could not begin to finish my small bowl. I cannot say it was my meal (since my husband had a bite of my fish and the same soufflee) but I was sick for two days with a stomach problem that lasted another few days beyond that! I think the fish was less than fresh though not actually BAD. Almost worse though than the lackluster food, the ladies at the table beside us pulled out a Groupon to pay for dinner. They were refused the discount and the owner came to the table and was very rude in explaining to them that the coupon would NOT be honored. Although it did seem that the ladies had mis-read the fine print, the display of anger from the manager was embarrassing and made me rush through my meal because I wanted to leave. It was so clear that the owner (manager?) had NO interest in making this experience one that might bring these ladies back in spite of their error. So sad. I've lived in Chelsea for years and indeed the original Trois Canards was lovely to both the eye and the palate.",1
"For many years i've had high hopes for the jamaica location and businesses. As soon as I saw The Moda being built I wondered what other businesses would they put near by. Applebees is a great start for the neighborhood but City Rib is definitely a way better choice. The staff is amazing. I've been here several times and every time has been a pleasant one. My first experience here was a nervous one because i'm gluten intolerant and know that bbq and gluten free doesnt really match. The staff was extremely friendly as well as the manager. He took the time to come to me and speak about the menu as well as to apologize for not having an allergy menu. ( I completely understood because a lot of business don't have one). The few times after that were as equally informational and pleasant. I of course ordered salad every time because although they have told me what I could possibly eat, I really don't want to get sick just in case of cross contamination. They have a jazz night on the weekends which is definitely very refreshing. Live music, great staff, and amazing food is definitely worth taking a trip to the jamaica area. There is potential here.",0
"I am convinced these guys are coasting on reputation and tourists reading these reviews and going to them. As evidence for the tourist claim, the guy in front of me in line had to ask what falafel is. I've never heard a more flyover country question in my life.

I love me some gyro and falafel, and I'd read the reviews of these guys, so when I saw them after leaving MOMA I decided to grab some falafel.

The line, as expected, was very long. I thought ""oh yeah, they're popular, this is a good sign."" There were three guys manning the stand, the most I've ever seen in one cart before. After five minutes of standing in line in the cold and not moving my girlfriend went up to see what was going on. One guy was making food (very slowly), two guys were just standing there doing nothing (it turns out one of them takes the money, idk what the third guy is for). They were seriously the slowest food cart I've ever seen.

I finally got my falafel, and it was just really sub par. It was cold, which, I mean, how fucking hard is it to keep some falafel warm? It was hard, greasy, and sour. I've never had sour falafel before. I don't know how you can even make it like that.
The one upside is it was cheap, but so is every other gyro-and-falafel cart in the city.

So, yeah, completely over rated, terrible, will never go back. Bad food, slow service, pretty sure they're just a tourist trap.

Edit: Update: It is now the day after we ate there, and my girlfriend has food poisoning. Hardcore diarrhea, all that fun stuff. Now, we also ate at a tex mex place yesterday, and it might be that, or something else entirely, but yeah. Not a good sign.",1
"The cheese fondue is only topped by the chocolate fondue, which ranks only slightly below the cocktails, each of which should be sampled, preferably the evening you decide to write a Yelp review.

I mostly love this place. There are some downsides, but they're not unique to BP. It's a tiny space and a crowded area, so getting a seat is a little hit or miss. It's also small enough that when someone gets a little sick and shares that piquant melange of chocolate, liqueur and stomach bile with the bathroom floor, it kind of sticks with the place for the rest of the evening. And it's a place popular with young enough people that this tends to happen a little too often. 

Still though? It gets sincere thumbs up for me. Cozy feel, delicious food, quiet enough you can hear your date think.",0
"Good summer time bar stop.  They have a rooftop which is pretty cool.  There is a good selection of beers as well.  I've been here half a dozen times and always enjoyed the experience.

Only reason I'm not gonna give this 5 stars is I got food poisoning the last time I was there after ordering a turkey burger.  I didn't eat anything else that day and it took days to pass.",0
"Why isn't there a negative star rating? This is what this bakery deserves. 
First incident. My husband has a gluten allergy so I figured his safest bet was an arepa de choclo. The waitress assured him there was no wheat in the arepa. He even had the waitress check with the baker and no wheat. WRONG!!!! There was wheat in the arepa. He brought a sample of the product and as soon I bit into it, I knew this arepa contained wheat flour in it. Why lie and take the risk of getting someone sick. Are you that greedy? 

So I tell hubby never to go back, but he does because he's always on the road and this time, he orders an empanada de cambrai. Why not? They looked plump and freshly baked. After he pays and he's well on his way, he opens the bag only to find a flat, stiff and unappetizing empanada de cambrai. The lovely waitress place all the fresh products in the front and the old ones on the back of the tray. 

People beware!!!!! These irresponsible Money hungry bakery are unscrupulous, greedy ($&@{}#%*

Ps.  Have you ever tasted cat food?  Try their empanadas de pollo; fresh out of the can. Yuck!!!! Never again!!!!!",0
"Love this little place! It reminds me of bakeries I've been to in Europe.  My 2 favorites are the blueberry clafoutis (fresh blueberries!!) & the raspberry linzer cookie. I love that the linzer is not typical of other bakeries, cinnamon dough & the jam is not sickeningly sweet. The eclairs & the flour less chocolate cake are also a delight. Eclairs have fresh whipped cream in them (my grandparents loved them! They're very picky). I'm a diehard chocoholic and some bakeries can kill their goods with too much chocolate. The flour less chocolate cake is not like that, it has the perfect amount.  Their coffee is great if you like the strong stuff.",0
The most terrible experience from all seven eleven stores they sold me ice cream that were melted and frozen again in which result u get a separate ice cream. Frozen foam on the top and frozen water on the bottom u know what I mean? The fact that I spent on it 4 bucks make me sooooo mad... Dumb people I could've get sick from that....,0
"Went here at 8pm on a Monday night. Wait was 30 min for 2 so we went around the corner to the other room for a drink.
We got a great corner table. Restaurant is quiet loud but has nice ambience. Shared artichoke salad special (raw artichokes, would have been better grilled). For pastas we got tagliatelle with ragu and spinach gnocchi with spicy red sauce. Tagliatelle was drenched in red sauce. I like that but maybe not for everyone. Spicy red sauce was so spicy it gave me a stomach ache. Should have stuck to red sauce. Pastas were average, hearty portions good for a cold night.
Tiramisu with dessert was covered in chocolate sauce. After scraping it off, tiramisu itself was pretty good.

Update:
I actually felt pretty sick after the meal as did my boyfriend. Like the atmosphere but wouldn't go back for the food.",1
"Long and detailed reviews are great, but nobody reads them, and I want everyone to read this.  This is not the same Indian place you've ordered from 100 times, even though its been 30 different places that have opened, closed, etc.. etc..

If you want bland Chicken Tikka Masala, go to one of those standard places.  But if you actually like the cuisine of Indian food, and are sick of the standard bland and oily dishes that are geared towards American tastes, then try this place.  This is what you will get if you eat at an Indian home.  Delicious and fresh tasting dishes that really do it justice.  About the only thing that differed from my meals (albeit vegetarian) at Sanskriti and my meals in India is the amount of spice.  Sanskriti understandably tones it down as to not shock their customers.  But otherwise this is the type of Indian food that turns the cuisine from a niche pig out meal to something you could conceivably eat every day and feel great, healthy, and not get bored by.  I absolutely love this place and I hope that it stays open for a long long time.  I intend to order more frequently from here just to do my part in trying to make that happen, and I urge you to do the same.",0
This really small restaurant has the best (real) Mexican tacos in NYC. I'm not kidding. My boyfriend and I started this quest over a year ago and we finally found this place! Are you home sick and want those tacos? Come here!,0
"I normally am not one to write reviews but I had to write one about my delivery experience. Last week I called this place to place an order for delivery. I was prepared for a stressful phone call as are most phone calls to restaurants when you want to place an order. Normally the person on the phone isn't very friendly and clearly hates their job, misspells your name or asks you 7 times what your phone number is, and always tries to rush my order making it very clear they want to get off the phone.
However, I was pleasantly surprised. A girl answered the phone by the name of Clara (I believe that was her name but I could be mistaken). Immediately from the start of the call Clara was extremely friendly and helpful. She talked to me as if I was an old friend, not just some customer bothering her. She gave me suggestions on what to order (which is very hard because I am not only dairy-free but also have a severe gluten allergy), even going so far as to check with the chef to make sure she had given me all the options. This meant a lot to me since a lot of times when I order delivery the person on the phone claims a certain item does not have gluten in it, however it arrives at my apartment, I eat it, and get extremely sick. She reviewed all my information to make sure it was correct but didn't ask over and over again which is something that really bugs me about ordering things over the phone. She did have to put me on hold to answer another call but I was only on hold for a few seconds and when Clara came back on the line she gave an apology that sounded shockingly sincere. 
When I was finished ordering she reviewed my total and thanked me for ordering with STIX. When I received the order there was a little note inside that said ""hey Paul! I hope you love your food. Just so you know I made sure there is no pita included in your order and also that your order did not touch pita since it had gluten in it and I seemed to have forgotten to say that over the phone. Have a great night! ~Clara"" 
That kind of customer service is unbeatable. From the way she talked to me on the phone, to her suggestions on what to eat, to the note she wrote to make sure that my food was gluten free....Clara truly made this delivery process much more pleasant than any other delivery I have ever placed. 
OH! and the food was delicious too!!! (I recommend the vegetarian stix!)",0
"Came here with the family before seeing Once on Broadway - my mother had a coupon and wanted to visit.
The food was nice - I had veal in a cream sauce with salad. The veal was a little tough, and literally swimming in the cream sauce which was fine (good with the bread) - the salad was fine. French martini for $14 was fine, although $14 seemed a little steep for a standard restaurant, not a swanky night-spot. The rest of the family enjoyed their food. The service was pleasant.
One complaint was that the restaurant had a bad odour. It smelled a bit like a toilet disinfectant, a sickly sweet smell. Hopefully they can address this smell.",0
Would give zero stars. I got food poisoning from their steak tacos. This place used to be my favorite Mexican food place but not anymore. Either the meat was old and bad or something was unsanitary in it.,1

My girl friend and I split a large pizza.  Half with pepperoni and half with peppers and mushrooms.

"One of my favorite bars in the Lower East Side, and I mean LOWER Lower East Side. 

I grew up around the area, just two blocks away, and I remember when it was just a local dive bar. Now it's got a New Orleans theme, even more divy-er, and the bathrooms are disgusting, but oh well, what bathrooms are clean in dive bars? 

I've had the dumplings once, it was just okay, I don't come to a dive bar for dumplings though, you can go across to Lam Zhou for the best dumplings in the city. 

I come here for super cheap ass drink specials, like $3 for a beer and shot during happy hour, and it's only goes up to $5 when it's not happy hour. There actually is a selection of cheap beer, like Miller High Life and PBR, and a selection of well liquor like whiskey, tequila and etc. There's also a selection of cider and good selection of drafts as well. 

I love the vibe and energy in the bar, even though 99% of the crowd isn't from NYC, I always have a good cheap time whenever I'm in the area. 

I'm hesitant to try the other foods, such as the raw oyster bar, cause the place looks kinda filthy, but then again, I've been eating in Chinatown all my life, so maybe I have a iron stomach by now. I'll update if I get food poisoning.",0

"*Review for delivery ONLY*

I can't speak to the actual service at the sit down restaurant, but damn they're fast with their delivery.  The General Tsao's I ordered (not very Chinese I know) was surprisingly pretty weak; too many peppers, bland chicken, and sauce that was sickeningly sweet... I could barely get through it... but the dim sum that was delivered was great!  

The pork buns were more like pork bun bites (or vitamins almost) and were nice and fluffy, with a sweet and savory chunk of pork in the middle.  The chicken feet though were the best though; if they screwed this part up, it would've been a minus few stars.  A bunch of chicken feet in a sticky black bean sauce... so good, falling of the bone.  And the dim sum prices are extremely reasonable.

Dim sum for delivery is definitely the way to go here.",0
"Their coffee is really, really good! 
I drink coffee everyday and was starting to get sick of it, until I discovered this cafe and the coffee was wonderful!",0
"Awesome place, but only visit the 6th ave cart. I've gotten sick a few times at their carts on 7th ave because the food isn't warm anymore due to fewer customers. Make sure you go to the 6th ave location because they're always cooking so you'll have a higher probability of getting fresher food.",1
I've had food twice from this joint. The first time I had ordered Masala dosa which was not bad..Not the best but yes palatable.The second experience was however horrible. Firstly the young waitress there was hardly cordial and was with a frowning face. I had ordered veg pakoras and a masala dosa. The pakora was bad and stale. I  fell sick and had to bear up with an upset stomach. Would definitely recommend avoiding the place.,1
"This place was not good. I ordered the eggs, gravy and biscuit with a coffee, and I was sick afterwards. My husband ordered the hamburger and it was RAW. RAW, I TELL YOU. 

The biscuit was cold and not made properly (I can't even mess up a frozen biscuit) and the gravy was weirdly garlic-y... I love garlic but it tasted like someone dumped a bunch of raw garlic in as an afterthought. Really weird.

Also, the service was helllllaaaa slooooow.",1
"As another reviewer mentioned this is the only Seamless Indian place in Bay Ridge. I had seen the less than stellar reviews but was really craving Indian so thought maybe they were wrong. They are not and I'm so bummed because I love delivery Indian.

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and what I got was a bowl of faded school bus yellow sauce that tasted mostly of cream and oil. The naan was not the fluffy kind I was expecting but seemed more like flour tortillas. It was literally inedible. I called them up and they sent a guy over with a new batch of the exact same crap even though I said I'd rather just a refund because I'd already warmed up leftovers because the oily cream was making me feel sick. 

I called Seamless and they contacted the restaurant that refused a refund and swore that the food was on par. Seriously? I can get better Chicken Tikka Masala from a Trader Joe's frozen meal! No thanks!

Save your money! There's an Indian place on the next block that isn't amazing but at least knows what color Chicken Tikka Masala is!",1
"Just... Whoa! Don't know where to begin but this place is going to be a hot spot in the coming year. I'd get in while you can. 

The small plates are incredible. Hands down the best mussels I've had in the city. That chorizo oil paired with the tomato confit really compliment the soft textured, perfectly prepared mussels. Encore!

Also had bites of my friends' charred octopus (super super super tender) & Kobe beef sliders. Nothing but simple and perfect flavor profiles. Must have. These meats are excellently prepared and really are the star of the show... So tired of over prepared dishes... Z Bar's chefs just let the simple flavors shine!

Girlfriend got the Peasant Mini Paella and it knocked us out. Mushroom risotto, confit of hen, duck chorizo, fava beans, and pancetta all snuck in? There's so many things going on in this dish and I have to say, it works perfectly! Perfect for a winter night when you need some of that stick to your bones cuisine.

We shared the Midtown Salad - CRISPY POACHED EGG???! I could eat a basket of those. Can't describe the flavor and texture, you just have to try it.

Seared Chilean Seabass & Roasted Organic Chicken were the mains. That Seabass is baaaaaaaad. It was seared so well and the creamy, moist texture of the fish was left in tact. Melted away in each bite. Need to get the recipe for that asparagus risotto... I love asparagus and the preparation there is just spot on.

That chicken... Man, I know I'm blowing smoke at this point but you have to try it. Again, that sear. There was such a nice golden skin on the most perfect juicy chicken you've ever had. Pure flavor paired with this decadent farro risotto to really contrast the lean chicken. Tad salty, but I dig salt. 

Anyways, now I'm fully hungry, sick and tired of trying to emulate their prep on the chicken dish, and planning my return to Z Bar. Lobster Mac & Cheese? That will definitely be on my plate next visit!",0
"Oh my gob! I loveee lovee lovee the chocolate here. 

Flourless chocolate cake with the raspberry sauce = to die for. It's all I get, but the chocolate gelato is also something else.

"It is clear that nobody that even remotely runs this restaurant reads Yelp, HOWEVER...

The hostess we had was very rude.  She basically threw the menus on the table, turned and left.  We then ordered our drinks and we got everything minus the waters we ordered.  After about 5 minutes there was an offer to refill my coffee, but I'd hardly touched it.  Once I did start drinking it, the server made no attempt to come to our table.  We even have a cocktail on the table (yes, one of those money makers!!!) and there was never an offer for another.

Food wasn't terrible, but the service made me sick.",0
"if you go to this perticular resturant, DO NOT EAT IN... DO TAKE OUTS... 
DO NOT GO THERE WITH FAMILY people who sits there the whole day HAS NO LIFE and they will stare at you untill you feel uncomfortable...
order 
chicken tikka masala
bihari kebob
chicken roast 
garlic naan
if you are not lucky, than wait to experience a food poisoning",0
"The worst.  I wish I could speak to the food, but I never got that far.  I was sick with the flu, so ordered in.  When the delivery guy finally got there, he insisted I come downstairs and outside (with the flu, in my PJs and bathrobe) because he ""couldn't"" come up.   Sorry, but when I order delivery, I want my food delivered TO MY DOOR.  I called Stay Fresh and the guy there stood by his incompetent delivery guy's refusal to bring my food upstairs, so I had it sent back.  

Stay away.",0
"Good place, good food. The bar is also good, and the prices are reasonable. Chinese food from most take-outs gets me sick, which is why I go here instead (so far no problems!)

Chinatown it ain't. But as far as suburban Chinese, it's good in a pinch.",0
"I used to like Food Gallery 32 and went here once in a while. However, I ordered Hae Jang Guk (spicy oxtail stew) from Hanok and got severe food poisoning. 

It was recently closed for sanitary health reasons and according to NYC's restaurant inspection information, they were allowed to open even after the inspection on 11/22/2013 with these violations: 

Sanitary Violations
1) Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.
2) Live roaches present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.
3) Facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.

That only amounted to ""9"" points and so they could open. They STILL have these violations. If taste is worth more than your health, go ahead. When they had closed on 11/13, they had 60 sanitary violation points. Imagine how dirty that was.",1
"I have gone to Sardis many, many times over the years when visiting NYC.  Unfortunately, I got the worst case of food poisoning that I have ever had last Friday night.  72 hours into it, and I am still not feeling too well.  I called to speak with the manager.  He could have cared less and offered a myriad of excuses, stating he had no evidence that I was ill.  I did not call expecting anything other than possibly an apology, but mainly I called so that they could contact their vendor to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I went to Sardis this time so that my niece could experience it as it is kind of a fun thing to do before a show.  My elderly mother, my niece, and I all got the filet medallions.  They felt a little nausea but fortunately did not get the full blown food poisoning.  My steak was very, very rare, instead of medium, and it was my fault for not sending it back.  I wouldn't have bothered writing this review had it not been for the extreme rudeness and unsympathetic attitude of the manager, when all I was doing was trying to warn him so that no one else would get sick.  I guess no good deed goes unpunished.  I am afraid I will never return to Sardis.  As a side not, after speaking to our concierge at one of the finest hotels in NYC, he informed me that they never recommend Sardis.  Too bad because the atmosphere is kind of fun. Finally, I overheard one waiter chastising our waiter to push the cheesecake because they had too much left over from Thanksgiving.  I fell for that and it was obviously not fresh.",1
"Tamarind Tribeca used to be my favorite place as I mostly had good time. But lately the quality has gone down and we got food poisoning when we last visited in November. When we contacted the management, they would never call us back. So, we wasted money on food, parking, baby sitter along with a wasted weekend trying to recoup from food poisoning. Horrible customer service!",1
"i have been eating in this place since they opened, their ""kacchi biryani"" in weekends were the bomb but as time passed by, they started to make money, and the quality of food went downard.... 
i was a huge fan of their kacchi byriani, trust me or not, i used to take the f train from the first stop to almost last stop to get this byriani and garlic naan, about 6 years ago, and now, i live by the resturant and i do not put my foot in the resturant... 
here are the reasons: 
1. they are very cheap when it comes to salad... 
2. they burn their food 
3. their service is only as good as if one of the owner, or their reletive is around (btw, i know them since i have been going there for so long)
4. servers does not know english, you will have a hard time ordering if you do not know bengali
5. here is the kick...... 
we ordered food for 30 people ones and all of us had food poisoning the next day
here is another kick... 
one of my friend who frequently eat there will never touch their kebob again, because he had serious sickness after eating it and than as we examined the kebob, the meat was very old theirfor it furmented and it didn't cook right...",1
"Its a nice place to go for drinks but their customer service sucks...the server himself gave me an attitude maybe because I had a big north face coat on. bc that day was like living in  the south pole...right until I spoke Spanish He started acting nice ...my girl noticed his face. N she was like wow ...she order a Colombiana soda n he gave us a clear plastic cup with ice while everyone had crystal cups. As food we order ""bandeja campesina "" while we waited he gave us free appetizers of mini empanadas of meat. The whole point to this story is that we both ended up with FOOD POISONING the following day and it ended today!!!  So if u and eat there make sure the food is cooked elwell done",1
"I have lived in the NYC area for 4+ years and I have never experienced the terrible service that I had at Jaiya tonight.  Our appetizer was great, we had veggie dumplings.  We shared a kale salad that was ok.  Then our entrees came and I ordered shrimp with cashew nuts and brown rice.  There was something in this that made me feel sick; my mouth was burning and was stomach felt upset.  I didn't complain to the waiter at all, I just asked him to take my plate away.  The dish came with 3 shrimp (smaller portions for a thai restaurant) and at this point I ate about half the dish and 1 shrimp was left.

I never asked him to take the meal off of our check, I was happy to pay for it, I just felt sick from eating it.  

Our waiter's name was Sal he was the sweetest man; someone should hire him to work at a better restaurant.  This review is about an overweight Asian woman (I didn't catch her name) who also worked at the restaurant.  

She came up to me and said that ""this is the last time we will take your meal off of your check, you ate almost all of your shrimp"" in a rude, condescending tone.  This was our first time eating at this restaurant.

I explained that I didn't even care about the check, it was fine, and Sal was so sweet.  She proceeded to tell me that I ate too much of my dish and was causing a scene at the restaurant.  Finally my boyfriend jumped in and said it didn't matter because we would never eat here again after the way she spoke to me.

As we were getting up to leave, she continued to yell at me on our way out of the door.  It was simply outrageous.  The hostess and all of the other staff we beyond pleasant, but this woman was one of the most terrible people I have encountered in NYC.",0
"This place should get zero stars. Yes the food was tasty and authentic AND I personally love a good ""hole in the wall"" AND can tolerate a little dinginess in my eating establishment, BUT this place was filthy! I even tolerated the people handling my food with their bare, grimy hands, but when roaches started crawling on the table while I was eating, I had to draw the line. I completely lost my appetite so I threw away my food and left. Then I looked and saw that their grade from the DOH was pending. Looked up why and found out that the health inspectors came to the same conclusion as I did!

So, I agree with the other reviews that the food is memorable but the unsanitary conditions are unacceptable and dangerous. Someone will get sick, likely already has. I would prefer they increase their prices, buy some gloves for food handling and hire a cleaning service. You have an authentic product, so have some pride in your establishment and respect for your customers.",0
"I gave this place another chance yesterday.
I wish I would just walk by and not given it any chance at all.
I spend the entire evening and night and morning in the restroom because I gave a chance to this place. My opinion this place should be close the owners should you are applied and how this place is managed.
My fellow patriots boycott this place because if you going to hear you will be sick from this place.",1
"I sent one of my anonymous ""diarrhea letters"" complaining about getting ill from the fish sandwich; I've now been here twice and all is well.",1
"I have ordered from here a few times but last night their food caused severe food poisoning.

I'd say beware of this place now.  Any time one person gets food poisoning, it will happen again.",1
"My friends and I have dined here before and the food was good. However on our most recent visit, Friday November 29th, after a enjoyable meal, all of us (11 in total) fell violently ill over the course of the weekend with a strain a food poisoning later found as Norovirus...SOME ONE DID NOT WASH THEIR HANDS

We ordered among us: NY Strip, Steak au Poivre, Roasted Chicken, Le Burger.

Though previously enjoyed going there for a good meal, we will definitely not be going again in the near future nor will be recommend to others.",1
Both my husband and I had serious food poisoning after having their woody allen pastrami sandwich for breakfast. I had to go home in the middle of work. Be aware of what you eat here.,1
"Took my GF here for Sunday brunch. 

1) This happened to be a very cold day and it seems as though the restaurant neglected to turn on the heat because everyone in the restaurant (including us) were wearing their jackets. Way to create a comfortable enviornment. 

2) I see my waiter jump behind the bar at one point, and when he comes over I mention ""oh your the bartender too?"" He replies ""No we just all work the bar"". I am all for employees helping out but this is Sunday brunch, they should have a designated bartender. And this explains why the service was really poor (had to ask twice for bread and hail people over to get a drink and a check)

3) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY we got FOOD POISONING. Now I know that the source of food posioning is very hard to prove however using deducution that myself and my GF only ate or drank together at this particualr restaurant within a 24 hour period prior to and didnt eat afterwards I can almost certainly say this place got us HORRIBLY SICK. Like ruined my Thanksgiving 5 days later sick, and I love thanksgiving. The food although tasting good was clearly contaiminated. 

THANKS FOR THE $95 BRUNCH FOOD POSIONING LANDMARC.",1
"I am a pretty regular patron and have always been fond of the grilled steak(it comes out sizzling on the plate). But after a pleasant dinner with my family on Sunday, I do not think I will be going there for awhile. We are all recovering from intense stomach illness. My two year old was the first one sick vomiting all night, then my husband, eight year old son and finally myself.  The only similar item consumed was the beans.  Like I previously stated I enjoy the food and service but I am reluctant to return.",1
I am home and sick and  wanted a chicken quesadilla... wow I had no idea they were going to be this YUMMY...... I will def. order again.... I like the rice here too because it is not SALTY like other places in the area,0
"Love soggy Mexican food? Like some tortillas that are soaked in refried bean juice paired with suspicious smelling lettuce and sour cream? Well then, this cramped hole in the wall -- which somehow maintains a cadre of flies inside the premises even in cold weather -- is your best bet for overpriced Mexican food which will probably give you food poisoning.

Three strikes and you're out, Noche de Margarita's!",0
"I went to  Locale for brunch.  I had a delicious omelette, the  Texas toast with nutella, and a body Mary.  The Texas toast was amazing.  It had just the right amount of nutella for an indulgent brunch dessert without being overwhelming.  Too much sweetness in the morning makes me feel sick, but the toast was fantastic.  The bloody Mary had a LOT of kick.  It was a lot of spice initially, but it disappeared just as quickly as it hit. I liked it a  lot. The fact that there was no lingering  bite made it easier to handle.  Also the decor is awesome.  It's cozy and classy and I love it!",0
"I walked in and was greated by Eddie, Saul, and Jeff, the managers and owner. They have charging stations right by the tables which are very convenient. The place has awsome decorations, a sick sound system, and good lighting that isn't too cluby. And to top it off 65 huge tvs with every game you could want.

First we had the nachos which were amazing. The chips were still hard and crunchy despite being cover in all the cheese, chili, quacamoli etc.

Then we had sushi which was very freah and tasty, I'm not a very big sushi person so I can't really elaborate. 

Next came the other appetizers. The mozzarella sticks were fried perfectly and the homemade marina sauce was to die for. The NYC style hot pretzels were better then any street cart in the city and it came with an amazing mustard that I can't even start to explain.

 Saul, Eddie, and Jeff kept coming to check on us throughout our meal and our waitress Lauren was very knowledgeable and friendly. The fishbowl was very cool amd even came with little Swedish fish swimming in it.",0
"Yuck on the ""Steamed Bun Sandwich"". They come four to an order. Got 2 chicken, 2 beef.......for which I was charged $8.95. The chicken is one thick flat grisly piece of meat coated in some sort of sickly sweet glaze. It had to be cut with a knife! Not good. The beef was just okay......a stingy portion......approximately one large tablespoon of beef. So basically you're paying for a steamed bun. I'll stick to the Moo Shu Grill truck for triple the portions....and a much better flavor profile!!!!!",0
"Perhaps the worst place I have ever eaten at. 

1 saw the guy drop a shaved potato pick it up and throw it in the container he had. 

2. Payed $2 for a kitkat 

3. Payed almost 8 for 3 bottle Poland spring waters

4. They had no minimum sign to indicate that there was a minimum for use of card, which I'm sure violated their visa, master card, Amex agreement.

5 extremely rude when I asked the guy if he seriously out back the potato, he replied are you eating it?

6. They have changed prices on me consitent claiming the guy made a mistake.

7. I was also charged for my own drink when I had repeatedly told the girl it was my water from another store. She still charged me in my card. 

I'm sure there are a couple of illegal activities going on in there, some staff members at my job got sick after eating the chicken broccoli there. Location is great and perhaps the only reason why they are still in business even after being shut down for a few days last year for what I believe were mice.",1
"BEWARE - FOOD POISONING! 
I ate here for lunch with a friend two weeks ago and we both got terribly sick from the fish! Furthermore, I tried to contact Sushi Shop on three different occasions to let them know and they still have not returned my email or phone calls. $30/lunch that make you terribly sick with non-existent customer service to boot? I think NOT.",1
"I have been a customer for several years. Lately for the past year I have only continue to eat there once and awhile as a loyal customer. But unfortunately my stomach and taste buds wont allow me to do this anymore. They have revolted. Last night I went there with my hubby and my child. One the empanadas were extremely dry, the meat so dry it was crumbling, the color look grayish and no flavor.  I ordered steak and thankfully the picture in the menu proved to me that it was steak because the taste sure did not. If I was blind I would have difficulties identifying this meat through the lack of flavor. My suspicions of the freshness of the meat were confirmed as my husband and I spent an a restless night sick to our stomachs. Sorry will not return anymore.",1
"Just had lunch here today after coworkers had been bragging about it for weeks as the best cheap sushi in manhattan.

But really, does one really want to combine the word cheap with raw fish? Ramen I can understand as all that steamy broth kills the deadly microbes. But i dunno, New York. I guess we all live knowing we're a short ambulance ride from the ER and so we live dangerously.

That said the waitress was cool. I ordered a la carte and asked her if I ordered properly. She said' ""Yes, better than my boyfriend"" and we both laughed. 

The food came. Everything tasted fresh but they serve the fish in pieces that are way too large (Americanized?) I hate that. 

Miso soup was delicious. As I finished my last slurp behold, a cockroach hiking over my chopstick wrapper. :(

I didn't get sick. Food was quite good. Ambiance - meh. Cockroach? A neutral three stars.",0
"Just came back and had an awesome lunch!  To be fair, the place is open for only 2 months and having come from a restaurant background many moons ago, it's almost impossible to get it right when the doors first open.  Consider that when reading some of the bad reviews and don't be afraid to go here.. it was fantastic!

For starters, the service was fantastic.   Ashley was our waitress and she took amazing care of us.  She was fun and she really knew the menu.  

We went for the true tapas experience.  Started with the avocado and heirloom tomato salads.  Both were very simple, fresh and tasty... as they should have been.   Then on to the main tapas.. Shishitos were exactly the way they should be.. piping hot and a gamble of heat... love them..   Grill asparagus was tender as can be and perfectly seasoned.  Octopus was different but in a great way!   Meatballs were pretty good... probably my least favorite but not bad at all.   Grill calamari was light and tender.   Tuna tataki.. pretty basic top quality tuna.. always a favorite.    The star of the tapas was the Fioe Grais .. i get so exited when I see this on a menu and so let down when it comes to the table as a pate... ugh!!  So frustrating.. Ok.. pate is decent but GIVE ME SEARED LIVER... yum!!!  it was outstanding with the potato pancakes and scallops. If you are a lover of this.. must try it!!   let me not forget the stuffed dates wrapped w/ bacon.. kind of a staple these days at any good ""plates"" place!!  

 We finished with the Flan which was second best I have ever had.  I can't give it the best because I have a very good friend (Owen) that makes it just a little better (ok.. it might be equal but he's my buddy).  seriously.. it was amazing!  The chef came over and explained how it was made and how it was passed down through the family.   it is way better than your average flan.   The chocolate moose was pretty sick too.   Very rich and smooth but with little pieces of chocolate throughout to add a little texture that was less familiar but really appreciated.  

Not sure why people are complaining about the Sangria.. although I have not had it my buddy has been there twice and bragged it is the best he has ever had.   The Taperia Old Fashion was just right for me.     Give me a good lunch buzz too!!  :)

let me finish with the was everything came out.   I hate nothing more than when the food just all comes out randomly and all at once.   Either the sever or the kitchen decided how it was all to come out in stages and they nailed it.   They probably sent it out in 4 to 5 stages.   We truly got to appreciate everything we were eating.   I can't stress how important this is.   We didn't instruct them to do it this way.. they just did! 

I recommend going there for lunch for sure and I plan to go back for dinner soon.",0
"I come here for sushi at least once a week. One time while I was eating it in-store a middle-aged man walked up to me and asked, rather conspiratorially, like he didn't want the employees to hear: ""is the sushi any good?"" he siad. ""be honest."" I'm going to tell you what I told him: I'm not a sushi conoisseur by any means, but it tastes fine to me, I've never felt sick from eating it, and since whenever you buy one pack of sushi you get a second one ($6 or less value) free, it's a great deal.",0
"One of my favorite dessert places over the years... still is. Ms. Chika - brains behind this operations - keeps her menu changing with the times...  Where there used to be cupcakes now are her version of the famous 'cronut' (of which she has made about  dozen flavors). Note i said ""her version.""  It would be overly simplistic to say she just makes her 'own version-' she truly transforms whatever it is that she is making into a lighter, fluffier, often less sweet and more variety of flavors, many of them 'asian' such as her incredible green tea milliecrepe cake.  

There is usually a bit of a wait - but for New York, it's not bad (perhaps 15minutes).  Come hungry - you'll likely want to order 2 desserts a person given all the options,  the fact that how light she makes her desserts you won't feel sick eating a few, and best of all - it's somewhat affordable!

The only imperfect thing about this place is that its small with limited seating. Small price to pay for a delicious cronut, mochi, slice of cake, cookie, etc.",0
"I always get congee here before heading home. The thousand year old egg (which is actually just fermented egg) and roast pork congee is only $4, and it's probably the best thing you could ever feed your body when you're sick. 
I tried their General Tsao's (?) chicken but was kind of disappointed. 
But I still stand firm on the congees. Ask for extra scallions/green onions. 

ALSO. I love this restaurant because I left my iPhone here at 10AM once, did not know where it was for the longest time, and when I finally realized that I lost it, I called it at 10 PM, and they picked up and told me that I left my phone at the restaurant. When I went, the worker there had tried calling my mom so that he could return the phone. SUCH SWEET PEOPLE HERE. I really love their friendly service and their integrity. 

And the congee.",0
...4906....I was one of the chefs that worked at under the bridge I worked there for 6 days n walked out I recommend noone eat there .there are plenty food safe violations raw chicken stocked in top of cooked food freezer burnt fries being cooked old food also being cooked I reported them to the health department the owners are nasty n rude and as u can see the reviews are all bad n the grade is pending which means they didn't pass there first health department evaluation ...I hope none of u get sick eating that food,0
"The unit price per dumpling here is very low, so you can get a lot of food cheaply.  BUT, this place is a dump, the staff was sick and/or hacking lugies into the trash can next to the fryer.  Although I know Chinese food is usually not made in the most sanitary environments it was a little too much for me.  I will not be going back, unless I only have 3 bucks and really really want dumplings.",0
"Just got severe food poisoning from here last night. Sucks bc I order from here all the time--love the chicken shawarma. But not worth what I just went through and am still going through. (Writing this review from my bed bc I'm not at work bc I don't want to throw up and do other bad things while I'm there). I don't wish this on anyone. You've been warned. 

Sucks that this has to be my first review. I promise I'll write five positive ones to make up for it.",1
I lived down the block from them for any years.  I've ate some reAlly good food from them and at time some really bad.  The last few time I've gotten sick I won't ever go back,1
"Now known as Akimoto Sushi.  Absolutely horrible experience.  My fiance and I ordered 3 rolls and and some edamame.  About halfway through the meal I ate something that tasted disgusting - most likely very old fish.  Several hours later, I woke up in a sweat and had horrible food poisoning for about 36 hours.  Unfortunately, my fiance also confirmed it was from our food as she had to leave work after about a half hour the next day as she began vomiting as well.  We called to notify them of their fish and they told us point blank "" Everyone knows that Sushi is dangerous to eat"".   This is literally what she told us.  WOW.   Then she offered a discount for a future order.  LOL.  

Never again and will be telling all my friends that live in the neighborhood to stay away.   You should too, unless you want a date with the porcelain throne.",1
"Time and time again I come here and it seems like there's always something wrong every time I do.  I'm getting kind of sick of it.

I've been coming here for years.  They have a great beer list and usually the draft list is good too.  

In the past, I've come across apathetic staff who know nothing about beer down to where the hell a beer is even located in their fridge.  It's really annoying asking questions about a beer when I obviously know more about beer than the bartenders in this so called reputable beer bar.  

Sure the bathroom situation is annoying with swinging doors that don't shut properly and an outside area that is closed at random times, but I still want a good beer - so I kept coming.

The last few times I experienced a draft system that was broken.  The bartender offered bottles instead but most were not cold or they were out.  Blarg.

And the last time I went it smelled like a pet shop.  I'm not even kidding.  My husband and I walked in and it took a few minutes to figure at that is wasn't a person smell but an animal smell.  I worked in an animal lab so I'm well aware of what I was smelling - rats.  Open a window, turn on a fan - something.  It isn't healthy to breathe that shit in all day long and honestly, we couldn't handle the smell after a few minutes. We chugged our beer and left.  This happened to be the one time the bartender was super nice, helpful and offered a well thought-out recommendation.  Where was this bartender the last few times I went when it wasn't smelling like a really nasty pet store. 

I have no idea if I'll be back.  I love the beer but the atmosphere is so all over the place that its a gamble the moment I walk in the door.  You have so much potential, D.B.A., fix yo shit.",0
"Delivery guy asked to use my bathroom. Massive diarrhea. Walks out, says he is sorry and that he had too much hummus from a large order that got canceled. You've got to be kidding. Brown residue left around the toilet bowl.",0
"Don't come for the Fro yo. I went with two other people. The employee working was friendly enough and was happy to share tastes. Each of us ended up getting the chocolate Fro yo, expecting normal chocolate flavors. We each tried it and all thought it tasted off. We asked the employee. One tried it and agreed it was indeed bad. To me it tasted rotten. To the employee ""the mix didn't stir in."" There was one other employee working who refused to taste it because of how awful it sounded when we described if. 

Neither if the employees made any effort to make this up. Aside from offering us more of the same bad Fro yo. Yuck. I'm already going to be sick from what I tried, why would I take more? 

We ended up leaving fully unsatisfied. Another customer walked in as we were leaving and was about to order the chocolate. I couldn't believe it but the employees  were actually going to still sell it.  I told the new customer and once I did that, the employee wrote "" out of order"" on the sign. 

Needless to say, I will never be returning to this place. Too bad.",0
"Awful! Save yourself and go down the street to El Aguila. I ordered a cheese quesadilla a 3 el pastor tacos, at midnight. The order took 15 minutes, while waitin I looked into their kitchen, since I noticed the B from the health dept, it was dirty, really dirty, no one was wearing gloves. When I unpacked the food it was a mess, the meat was unidentfieable, the quesadilla was melted together into 1 block of cheese and tortilla, it was awful. My girlfriend is now sick, from the little food we did decide to eat. Really terrible place!",1
"Be weary of FOOD POISONING ! 
My room mate ordered the tempura ramen and I, the Godzilla roll and we got deadly food poisoning for 24 hours. 

It's a shame this made us so sick and we'll never, ever order from this place again. 

Be warned.",1
"Food poisoning, me and 4 others whom I ordered for. Stay away! If you order and the same happens, don't say you don't know!",1
"First Chinese in NYC. Great and good value. Nice server. But I think the bus boy was sick as the waiter asked him loud enough for us to hear ""are you feeling better today?"" And he just said ""ugh..."". I could've gone without hearing that, but other than that the food was great, service was good, and the environment was cool.",0
This place has probably the best Kaprow Moo Grob. I get it every single time I come here and I never get sick of it. Waiters are very nice and friendly. Definitely would recommend that dish and some Hoy jor. Cheap and delicious Thai food.,0
"Got sick after eating their food truck burger.

Stay away!",0
"My husband and I have been going to and ordering take out from Georgio's for about a decade.  I can't believe I'm reviewing it for the first time now.  It's just one of those places that always tries to please its customers, so you just keep going and enjoying it but never write about it. We went today, and I said, we should really review this place. 
So, here it is: this place is very good.  The best things about this place are:
- The food is good/safe (never been sick from food here, and the fries today looked really fresh like the oil had just been changed)
- The service is very smooth - the servers are always accommodating requests
- The owner/manager (I should know his name already) is really accommodating and aiming to please customers.  He's truly a smart businessman and very pleasant natured
- The fresh squeezed juices and oreo heaven shake are delicious (I haven't had any other shakes)
- The food is like a diner but the atmosphere is more ""country""
- The bathroom is always clean (huge plus in my book, especially in nyc where a majority of bathrooms - even in more expensive restaurants - are disgusting)
- the delivery is always quick and if I've had problem, they've remedied it

The not so great thing about this place is that the food is not excellent.  It's very good to good.  I don't love the way they make omelets, and I almost always want an omelet when we go out for breakfast.  They're a little too well done for me.  The burgers are good and the fries are usually delicious.  I've tried other menu items and I don't remember them.  I haven't had the bbq sauce in a while (maybe 5 years,) but I remember not loving it.

Like i said, it's very much like a diner with ""country kitchen"" kitsch.  The difference between this place and a diner is the fresh juices/shakes, the clean everything (open kitchen, too), and the exceptional service from everyone on staff.",0
"Horrible. Never ever step foot in this again unless I get take out. Honestly, I'm not a picky person. You serve me the food and I'm happy. But the service sucks! I remember coming here two months ago with my boyfriend and a friend. I was pretty sick so I ordered a toad congee and they each had a sizzling plate of beef and swwet and sour pork. The food was decent. we went in around 10:30 or so and it was only a few tables that was already eating. However! We were seated and we bascially knew what we had to order in less than a minute, so we wave our hand to an incoming waiter and i assumed he saw us because he walked directly towards us. Turns out, he went past us to a table behind us that had a group of 6 or 7? And he took their order. Which I was kinda confused but rather let it slide because he might have not seen us. So he came over afterward and placed our order. Then things got bad. My congee came pretty quick and each of us had a bowl and there was still more. But then the beef and the sweet and sour pork took another 20-30 mins. I was done eating before they got their food. Ironically, the table that ordered before us, which they had lobsters and all the other rather fancy food that are actually time consuming, was already there. That got us pretty pissed off. Because I honestly don't think beef and pork takes that long to cook. Especially when you're not even busy. But whatever. We ate, got the bill. They even had a little section at the bottom where you can comment on their service. I didn't have anything to write with, or else I would've put horrible. BUT. That wasn't the point. The point was, we gave about 5 dollars tips for less than $40 or $50 of food. And we took off about $1 because of the shitty service. The waiter seriously came running after us and said we didn't give them enough tips. I thought, tips is what customers give you when they are satisfied??? If I am happy, I am willing to give more than 15% tips. But i walked out that night giving an extra $5 and I told myself. Never again.",0
"you guys are getting one star for slandering my new favorite taco truck up on 41st st on foursquare. for some reason there's a glitch whenever i try to report it as such. 

someone wrote, on foursquare, that they ate at tia rosas (the new taco truck) and it gave them food poisoning and sent all their friends to the hospital. uhhhh... a bit drastic sounding. so i looked at the profile, and saw that not only was it the only tip that had ever been left by that profile, but they had liked every positive comment ever left for Mexican Tortas & Tacos. and that comprised all their activity on foursquare, ever.

you guys suck, and now i will never, ever eat at your taco truck.",0
"Been coming here for years, but lately I can't give them anymore tries... I used to love the pizza, all different kinds.. But I'm sick of miserable staff, and all the slices they have out look like they are over a day old.. It would probably be more cost efficient to make a couple of new fresh slices every 3-4 hrs rather then using 2 day  old pizza. As for the miserable staff, I'm sorry I order a couple of slices and give you a tip..what was I thinking?",0
"I don't know what you guys are smoking! The food was terrible! I have been to many Filipino restaurants in NYC including Long Island and this restaurant ranked last in my book! The service was very good so they get a star for that. I tried going there at least 3 times but they failed me over and over again!  I hope I don't get sick from their dinuguan because it tasted horrible. Even though it is close to home, I rather drive to Woodside or Long Island. Never going here again! $16 for their buffet? Are you kidding me! Over-priced! I'm sick to my stomach!",0
"We live in the area but rarely tried this place.  But since the other place just changed hands again, and based on the good reviews, we ordered take out from Sushi Yoo last night.  What a mistake!  The salmon tasted funny and had a question film over it, the Dragon Roll seemed wet and soggy, and the soy sauce was actually watered down!  I didn't mind my spicy salmon roll or Masago, but my wife got sick from the Dragon Roll, her salmon roll and spicy shrimp.  Not going back.",1
"I got food poisoning from the chicken curry. This was the second time I went here, but never again.",1
"Nice people food tastes good, but the last two times I ate here I got sick with an excruciating headache. Their menu says no msg but they put it in the food anyway even when you ask for them to keep it out. If they actually omitted msg from their food I'd give them a higher rating.",1
"Ordered the Crunchy French Toast, and it was soggy in the middle. I ate around it, but it still made me sick. The French press coffee had a bad flavor to it. The server picked up check while I still had the copies signing, and then he returned angry because I hadn't finished signing.",1
"One of the worst culinary experiences of my life. The food was awful, a lot of the ''hot'' food had gone cold. The service was poor, they spoke little to no english which didnt help.they brought me my check with a %25 tip already added. My friend who i ate with got food poisoning. All in all, i wish i hadn't gone there,",1
"got sick from the buffet food.  It is not fresh nor is anything else there.  They have been known to double tax and even charge for lettuce and tomato on sandwiches.  you can get anything that they sell here from subway, dunkin doughnuts, and the 711.",1
I would give this place zero stars if I could. The food here is disgusting. The deli meat is old and it made me sick. The people they have working in there are very rude. The sandwiches are extremely over priced. Stay away from this place!!!,1
"I really, really WANT to love Cebu. I have had fun experiences there with friends, colleagues and family. However, on more than one occasion either myself or someone I was with has gotten sick after eating at Cebu.

 One night we took a family friend here for dinner and my fiance had to rush home right after because he had stomach issues. Another time I got really sick from eating pasta and drinking wine. Last night I ended up getting sick after eating a few pieces of calamari and 2 vegetable spring rolls. I am quite certain that many, if not all food items, are not made fresh. It is a tiny step up from chain restaurant food. 

 I love wine and I am a bit of a wine nerd. The wine at Cebu is of poor quality. Any wine that I have tried is extremely acidic and makes my stomach sour and my head ache almost instantaneously. 

 On the plus side, the waiters at our work parties have always been attentive, professional, and nice.

 If they would improve the quality of the food and drinks about 20 notches it has potential to be a fantastic spot in Bay Ridge. As of now, this place is extremely disappointing and I will not be returning.",1
Spent 10 dollars on a bland half mozzarella sandwich and tea. The sandwich was not fresh and I felt sick eating it. The woman at the service had a huge attitude and could not even handle a simple order without dropping change around. Total waste of money and I lost my entire appetite. Would give negative stars if could.,1
"Food poisoning. I live around the corner and ate here often, until now. The staff is rude and seem to dread serving anyone. Skimpy sandwiches. Bottom line, food poisoning. Shut this dump down. It's disgusting.",1
"Pretty short and sweet: last time I ordered from here (which was back at the end of May), both my fiancee and I got a bad case of food poisoning. The nizami chicken curry had a sauce that was too watery to start with, and the flavoring was a bit off as well. The next day, I faded hard at the end of the day and endured an unpleasant cleansing of the body (if you catch my drift), thanks to something not being quite right with the food.

So...yeah. Given it was the only thing we had eaten before we had both eaten before we got sick, we're quite sure it was food from Chote Nawab that was the cause. Not going to take another chance.",1
"This place was very very poorly. I've been to almost every diner in Queens NY. And this is by far the worst diner. Their customer service is horrible, the way they talk to people is disgusting and their food was not correct. I've worked at diners and catering halls. And you Classic Diner absolutely remarkably awful. My daughter got a whole entire long hair wrapped in her chicken fingers, fries weren't even crispy or anything for that matter. Onion rings and fries were soggy. Burgers were burnt. They don't know how to read a simple order even on their online site with yelp.com and matters all need to be re-educated once again. I know your one who deals with my food. But this is my 1st time ordering from this diner. And you damn straight will know I'll never order from here ever again. Even if I was dying. It's not epic at all. It's disgustingly sick and nasty!!",0

"Got sick after eating their food truck burger.

Stay away!",1
Do not believe the hype of this place. Its a tourist trap and is actually one of the worst pizza places in the city. Go somewhere else and save your time and money. This pizza also gave me food poisoning.,1
"Well, all is NOT WELL here at this McDonald's though it's not that the food has made me sick but the management has.

I've been enjoying a ""two-fer"" here; you take your receipt home, go to a McDonald's website, answer a few questions and at the end you get a code number to put on your receipt for your next visit.

Well, the young miss prowling the front of the house where the registers are denied me my two-fer, which in my case was two DOUBLE Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, something I've already had like six or seven times before.

She also said that the number I'd put on my receipt from the McDonald's website was invalid.

The offer says that I can have any two LARGE McD sandwiches as part of the offer and what isn't larger than a double Filet-o-fish sandwich?

Indeed, the cash registers already have this sandwich pre-programmed as a specific cash register key.",0
"A pretty decent mom and pop place! It has a nice, home-y feel to it. I've heard that this place was popular and the line goes out the door most times but we got lucky because it was the day after Thanksgiving and they were able to seat our party of 7 together with no wait!

They have your typical diner menu options. I opted for the eggs benedict because I started an addiction to Eggs Benny earlier this year and now I must try it wherever I go. It was pretty tasty! Not the best but still a delight to eat. And the home fries it came with....mmmmm mmm! I just love potatoes in general and their home fries were a nice compliment to the eggs benedict. I washed it all down with a nice warm cup of hot chocolate (because coffee makes me feel sick and nauseous).

Overall, food was decent. I liked the atmosphere. Servers were friendly and prompt. If you're ever in this side of the neighborhood, give this place a try!",0
"I should have heeded the other negative reviews, but I was too enticed by the $3.95 all you can drink bloody marys, and for that I was punished with RAW EGGS.

I ordered Uova Al Forno (eggs baked with tomato sauce and oregano). It arrived barely warmer than room temperature, but I decided sending it back would have taken forever... big mistake. About halfway through, I got a big mouthful of RAW egg white which I had to spit out into my napkin. 24 hours later, I still can't get the feeling of it out of my mouth, but luckily at least I'm not violently sick from salmonella. The triangle shaped latke it came with was also cold, greasy, and completely tasteless.

To top it off, something was floating in my friend's water glass, and it took a long time to flag someone down to ask for a change of water, and a refill on mine. The bloody marys were ok, but so full of horseradish that it was kind of gross after a while. The refills also arrive warm (they pour from a room temperature carafe) and it was next to impossible to get the waitress' attention to ask for ice. I should note that the woman refilling our drinks was lovely and very sweet. The other waitress was totally aloof until it was time for us to pay. The bill was on the table 2 seconds after they picked up our plates, without even asking if we needed anything else or how the food was (I never got a chance to tell anyone about my raw plate of gross-ness). At least the coffee was delicious (although we were never offered a refill).",0
"I wish I can give this place a five, but I can't. 
This place is filthy. Our bench seatings we're sticky I guess from the club night before. There were too many flies flying around which it made it annoying while trying to eat. This place is lit pretty dim, I guess they don't want you noticing all the dirt and dust,  insects and I'm sure rodents. 

I went to use the bathroom and out of 6 doors I'm hoping I chose the filthiest one. There was still vomit in the sink and shit stains on the toilet bowl. Wowzerz.... Really. 

Great landmark building. This could be a great establishment but they lack sanitary wise. I don't even want to know or imagine how the kitchen looks like. 

I went in there with a Groupon for 4 four course pre fix menu. We ordered the prime rib and the red snapper filet. Every food item given was really good and well seasoned. Three stars because of the food and decor. 

My friends and I enjoyed ourselves, but I also have to mentioned that we did come out with a little backache from hovering too much since we're eating on top of  coffee table basically.",0

I grew up in NY and have been eating wood/coal fired pizza my whole long life and this place is my favorite. The pizza is sick. but the sides and wines are beyond what you can get at any other pizza restaurant. Had the quail egg and asparagus pie which was amazingly decadent.,0
If you are sick of Starbucks try this place out. Makes the best coffee in Astoria. I hit it up 2-3 times a week.,0
"While there was a line of 4 customers, I saw the staff jokingly do nothing in front of my eyes while there was nothing left to do other than put the food into the boxes. This went on for 10 minutes. There were customers who didn't even have their orders taken.

On top of that they got multiple orders wrong, and there were only 4 customers on line! They had 4 people behind the counter. It's mind boggling how incompetent they were.

On top of the bad service, I puked up my lunch. It was gross and disgusting. 

I should've known better. If the service was that terrible then how do I know that the food is fresh, not passed the expiration date, how do I know that the cooks washed their hands.

I don't. 

Don't go here. You'll get food poisoning.",1
"Don't order from here if you have a sensitive stomach!!! I order from from this place using seemless and got: curry chicken, papayas salads,  and fish cake! They are really delicious,  however right after the meal I got a reaction of diarrhea!!!",1
"i ordered there 4 times.... the first three times i was blown away by how cheap there food was.... the food was good, and the price made all the difference.  HOWEVER the last time i ordered I got very sick.... throwing up, sweating, stomachaches, throwing up, i couldn't do anything the next day, must of been some type of food illness. I haven't eat there since. i really wish i didn't get sick because i would eat there more often just because how cheap there food was... but then again, maybe i got sick because of how cheap there food is.",1
"Worst food ever!!! Do not order from this place! I ordered food on grunhub from this place yesterday and not only did they not come upstairs to deliver the food but the food was horrible. The pasta tasted bland and like plastic, the fries were soggy, the cheesecake and Boston cream pie only tastes like cold butter, the morir soñando was too sweet and didn't even taste like morir soñando and to top it all off they forgot a lemonade I ordered. I only ate a little because I could not stomach it and it still made me sick.  Skip this place unless you want to get sick and waste your money on crappy food!",1
I got food poisoning from this place. I ate a veggie burger with the avocado range with the 5N sauce and hand cut fries. Threw up 3 times and continuing diarrhea..  The worst day after the meal. Ate on 12/7,1
"Worms........I thought the flavor was delicious, but the only problem was that there were two worms in my dumpling soup. God only knows how many I ate before I realized this and had to induce vomiting. I'm in scientific research a a university in NYC, and the worm is not toxic or necessarily detrimental to one's health, just rather disgusting.",1
"I got violently sick after eating here. If you take a look at the department of health website, this place has a bad track record of inspections. It's also very shady and disingenuous that they don't comply with the law and post their bad inspection grades in the window. With so many good restaurant options in the vicinity, DON'T TAKE THE RISK OF GETTING SICK FROM EATING HERE.

Update: Forgive me for not responding within 3 days to an email from a place that got me sick.  I happen to be very busy at work right now. Anyway, I ate there on a Saturday night in March. I felt  I had to write a review after walking by recently and noticing no health grade posted, looking up the history, and being shocked and dismayed - something that Michelle conveniently glosses over.",1
"Pretty bad overall experience. Service was very slow and inattentive. We ordered pork katsu and beef udon soup. Both dishes were 20 minutes apart, greasy and pretty bland. To make things worse both my mom and I got sick afterwards. Would not recommend this place.",1
"Yup... they are rated C by the DOH... but that probably makes it just as clean as your average Malaysian hawker stall. Damn good Malaysian for NYC, run by Malaysian Chinese, so I would steer clear of the mostly-Indian dishes, such as roti canai - definitely comes frozen and warmed up in the kitchen.

We had the following
Roti Canai - pass
Hokkien Char Mee - great, not as dark as in KL, but very respectable
Beef Rendang (menu subtitle: ""Love me Tender"" hahahaha) - sublime
Popiah - just OK, they squirt sriracha and hoisin sauce on top, kinda funky.
Assam Laksa - pretty good
Belacan Kangkung - pretty good but kinda hard to screw up

To drink:
Kopi peng (iced coffee! ... served in a funky styrofoam cup)

Overall we were stuffed silly and out the door for under $20 apiece. To my knowledge, no one got sick. So there.

If you want to be careful, just pretend you are in Malaysia and wipe all the dishes with a pack of tissues when they come out for the most authentic experience. :)",0
"Walgreen's bought Duane Reade a couple of years ago, which raised my rating of this location from ""Run for Your Life"" to ""Exhaustingly Difficult.""  See my SURVIVAL TACTICS below. 

The pharmacists are nice, well informed, conscientious, but slammed.  It helps to get to know them, as you'll want ALL questions answered by a pharmacist.  The pharmacy assistants have kind, courteous days and very surly days, but, there's no day when you can trust them for accurate information (Well, there's ONE experienced tech, IF you insist AND she has the time).  

Whether it's about medication, insurance, or their OWN records, trivial or vitally important, and even if I ask them to check again, the answers are wrong. It's consistent and serious. 

By no means are these bad or stupid people. It's poor management.  The too-small support staff is inadequately trained (I'm told the pharmacists are frustrated too). Plus, the way they try to brush off questions is so uniform that they must be directed to do so.  I've reported the problem to Walgreen's national office--no change.   

Yet, 111th is my best option now.  Disappointed when they first opened, I'd tried other places:  7 years with the dreadful RITE AID on 110th, which boasted 45-minute lines at 2 a.m., terrifying Rx errors, angry staff, and a filthy store teeming with mice, BUT was national and 24/7;  a few decent months with DR on 108 & Amsterdam, except they weren't natn'l yet + they'd shutter the pharmacy for the day if the pharmacist got sick (!);  5 years with the excellent CVS on 86th & Amsterdam until it became impractical.  Then, after a bad third try at 111th,  I went to Walgreen's on 97th & B'way, which delivered evenings and was superbly managed by pharmacist Mr. Nehru (I miss you!). He left big shoes to fill when he was transferred, but it's still pretty good. Then, sniffle!, they stopped delivering to my area (I get it--there are at 5 DRs bet 97th & 111th).

At least now 111th  is 24/7, delivers during the day, and is part of a national chain. This helps me, though I DON'T get why it's harder to fill a scrip here than elsewhere. 

After a year's experience, let me share the following survival tactics: 


1:  Never go there in a hurry.  A simple transaction can wind up resembling an excerpt from Kafka's ""The Trial.""  You'll get angry AND you'll have to come back again.  Avoid the evening rush (5-7p) when the line is long, there isn't enough staff, it's hard to get pharmacist help, and tempers flare.  Late night is my favorite, early a.m is good. Other times vary. 


2: The pharmacy assistants will automatically answer ""No, we can't,"" ""No, you can't,"" or ""No, your insurance doesn't"" to any question you ask. (Ahh, you could close your eyes and almost imagine you're in Paris). If they do agree to check into your query, 99% of the time you will get a wrong answer. It's even worse over the phone.  (Like I said, it's bad management.)

Beware: even after you know better, your reasonable nature will lull you into thinking, ""Oh, THIS question is simple and common enough for the PAs to answer.""  As soon as you realize your mistake, try to get hold of yourself.  This is the flash point where so many succumb to flailing, strangulated temper-tantrums.  If you have a sedative, take it. Then proceed to # 3. 


3:  Thank the P.A.s warmly, then quietly sidle over to the left end of the counter, where you will be within eye- and earshot of the pharmacist.  Smile and wave to let him/her know you're there, then wait with all the patience you can muster, for the pharmacist will be simultaneously:  

    (a) FILLING a prescription (maybe yours!); 

    (b) TRYING not to crack through 30 minutes of awful ""hold music"" and mocking repetitions of ""Your business is important to us...,"" piped at full volume on speakerphone, until an insurance rep comes on for the day's 27th attempt at making sense of deviously complicated Rx plans; 

    (c) STRAINING to ignore the misinformation being given to customers just 8 feet away, while remaining poised to rush in and intervene before the next, inevitable altercation erupts;

    (d)  TURNING back to the pill counter, trying to remember which prescription s/he'd been filling, then moving on to the huge stack of scrips still waiting.

As you've been undeterred, the PAs will now offer to help. Smile and wait.   As soon as the pharmacist is free, you'll get help.  On meds and interactions etc, they're very good. On the rest, you'll get an accurate answer,  though not necessarily a  GOOD one. Again, this is much easier at off-peak hours.  


4:  Check your prescription against the medication you receive.  Make sure it's the right med, and that the quantities of pills and refills are correct.  (Of late there's been a new discrepancy between refills on the bottle and in their system).


5:  If you're happy or unhappy with the service, PLEASE contact Walgreens online or by phone. We NEED a good pharmacy.",0
"We went there because the restaurants that we wanted to go were not open and this is the closest asian food nearby. The decor and presentation of the place looked decent - but very soon we had regrets.

When we entered the restaurant, the people who worked there looked at us, then just ignored us like they didn't see anything.

So we worked further into the restaurant and just stand there, finally someone got us and my husband said the people who work there looks like a zombie, so lifeless and you will see why.

We asked what is good. Being Chinese in a Chinese restaurant, we just wanted something more authentic so we asked that question but the waiter said ""we have pig, seafood, beef and vegetable"" Right like I am illiterate and can't read the menu?

Anyhow, we ordered some food and the first dish was the lotus leaf rice, and I spit it right out on my first bite. It was SPOILED. I was not looking for something delicious, I only wanted something to eat, but that dish totally tasted spoiled and my husband agreed. The sticky rice was also not heated all the way, some part was warm, some part was cold and spoiled - it was a taste of foulness. We spit it back out, and the waiter collected the plate and asked ""are you finished""? I was speechless I didn't want to make a scene. 

They recommended the beef as ""fresh"" so we ordered it, and trust me - Panda express or ANY Chinese take out place does better. Their beef was so overdone with baking soda you can't taste any beef in there.

We both came to the conclusion that the hot water the best out of everything. We got so tricked into this place by the high rating and please don't go there - if you don't want food poisoning please stay out.",0
"My college friends and I have an annual secret santa exchange that I organize and it's always hard to find places that take large reservations (14+) without enforcing a pre fixe menu. Forcella is awesome in that respect because I was able to make a reservation for 14 on Open Table!! Sick.

I've been to a different location of Forcella so I know their pizza is bomb. We ordered bottles of wine for the table and some of the boys opted for beer. For appetizers, we ordered octopus, calamari and tuna tartar. They were all spectacular! The olives and potatoes that came with the octopus were equally as good as the octopus itself!!

The pizzas here are actually a little different than their downtown location. I had the burrata, prosciutto and arugula pizza. It was loaded with arugula which I love! The middle of the pizza was a little soggy though so it was had to pick up and eat. My guy friends found the crust to be a little lacking, but I like that doughy bread like texture.

We were a bit loud because there's 14 of us and we were drinking and opening presents. I guess the table next to us complained and management had to come over and tell us to simmer down. This was kinda lame because we were clearly having a good time and ordering a lot. They also forgot one person's order and we had to ask for it later and didn't serve any bread for the table.

Semi soggy pizza, being scolded by management and forgotten dish = minus 2 stars.",0
"Good summer time bar stop.  They have a rooftop which is pretty cool.  There is a good selection of beers as well.  I've been here half a dozen times and always enjoyed the experience.

Only reason I'm not gonna give this 5 stars is I got food poisoning the last time I was there after ordering a turkey burger.  I didn't eat anything else that day and it took days to pass.",1
"I would give this place 4 stars if I were reviewing it as a bar -- unfortunately I got food poisoning from their food which is why I gave it two stars.  

While I was there, I had a good experience.  The bar tenders were friendly (as were the locals). I don't know if I can trust them with food again but I'm definitely willing to be open minded and chalk up my experience to be a fluke. Especially since they have great reviews.

For now, I'll come back for the drinks. I really wished I had a better experience -- Catfish has so much potential.",1
"Being from California I know good tacos, and this is not the place for them! Sick to my stomach all day, after trying chicken and steak tacos. Skip this place if possible.",1
"WARNING: My friend got food poisoned from their lobster.

I wonder if the chef was on his leave because my experience was beyond disappointing. 

We each ordered a $94 four course menu and got one appetizer, one pasta, one main course, and one dessert. 

Appetizer - Foie gras. The portion was almost too large for a first course that it killed the dish's delicacy. The caramelized onions on top was too sweet to swallow. It covered foie gras' freshness and fragrance (or maybe it was just not there without the onions). I'm a foie gras lover but this was too greasy for me to finish the plate. 

Pasta - Trofie Nero. Seriously what's the hype with this pasta? It was too salty and had a texture of uncooked flour dough. I can get squid ink pasta way better in taste and half in price. 

Main course - Steak. The steak was just decent, nothing impressive to please my taste bud. But an average dish was good enough to be the star of the night. 

My friend gave me a bite of her lobster and I sensed a fishy smell. Her stomach felt really weird on her way home, followed by a rough time in the bathroom. BEWARE OF THEIR SEAFOOD.

Dessert - We picked 6 different desserts. They were either too sweet or too bland. The pear gelato was probably the best one because it tasted like pears.

Service - One server mixed our orders so my friend and I had to exchange our pastas by our own hands. 


I understand this is a Michelin one-star restaurant so maybe I was just unlucky. But with a $150 bill I could get some top-notch sushi or buttery steaks.",1
"One star - coco diablo and smooth sangria
Two star - Sunday football on big screen (YAY!)

The rest ---- FOOD POISONING.  I wrote to Camaradas and requested a free sangria pitcher for a future visit.  We had burgers and sangria, the culprit. Today we are just spending quality time in the wc.",1
"NOTE: Scroll to the bottom to see why this is one star.

My girlfriend and I have been meaning to come here for over 4 years now. Yes, I know, we're like an old married couple by now. All I have to look forward to now is midlife crisis and college tuitions for my bratty kids. And yes, they will be bratty.

I mean how could we not come to Benny's, I practically own the place with them using my name and all. I should probably ask about royalties on that..

We ordered the Mole Ole!! Burrito and the Beef Chimichanga. We also had an order of the Salsa Fresca & Chips. I had really high hopes for our order as I had never tried mole sauce or chimichangas before. I started with half the chimichanga first. It was, to say the least, very bland. There was literally no taste coming from this deep fried burrito. The only way I was even able eat it was by adding lots of hot sauce, sour cream, and salsa. The mole burrito wasn't that much better. Although it did have the added benefit of having a mole sauce adding some flavor to everything. It still needed a hit of sour cream and a little bit of hot sauce though. I felt that the chips and salsa was probably the best thing we had. The salsa was chunky and fresh. There was a minimal amount of tomato juice making everything soggy. I usually hate having salsa because I hate watery salsa. My only gripe with this was that there was so little salsa for such a large basket of chips.

We were forced to purchase 2 bottles of beer with our meal. Ok, I probably would have ordered one anyway but what I'm about to tell you will make you do the same. The ice container, which is the ice that they use for the glasses of water, the glasses of cocktails, and crushed for the frozen margheritas, was located against a wall in a tiny pathway directly across from a dirty puke and pee covered bathroom. Guess what goes right next to the ice container. If you guessed the busboy's plastic container of dirty plates and discarded food then you'd be correct!

We luckily didn't get food poisoning from here but I don't think I'll take my chances. Well we tried it. It took 4 years but we did. We will not be returning.",0

Food:  pretty delicious, not the best value I've ever seen.  I got the pork sliders with fried eggs on top.  Pretty good, I'll give them that, but the side salad and potatoes were throwaways.  I can also get the same quality for better prices elsewhere.  $19?  Meh.  I'll stick to a million different places in Brooklyn, thank you.

Space:  cute, but they are trying to fit in about 30% more people than they should--it is CRAMPED in there.  I'm a pretty small girl and I couldn't get into my seat without at some point accidentally passing my butt across another table.  The ""garden"" area was cold, which was not unexpected, and everyone was packed in like sardines.  Just seeing how packed it was almost gave me an anxiety attack.  They tried to seat the 5 of us at a 4-person table.  Then they charged us the mandatory 20% gratuity that is applied to groups of 6 or more.  Not cool.

Staff:  not the worst...  the hostess seemed like a nice person, but ultimately she apologetically made an active decision not to take any action to make our dining experience better.  The waiter was nice enough, but forgot an order.  The busboy was actually rude:  when I tried to get his attention, he actually shook his head at me and told me he wouldn't respond to me...?!

Ambiance:  THE WORST.  I wanted to have a lovely brunch over French food with my friends.  I actually couldn't hear them because the horrible music was so loud.  I asked them to turn it down, and they actually said they couldn't because one of the speakers was broken...?!  I guess they figured that for some reason it was absolutely necessary to have thumping club music blasting at a very specific level during Sunday brunch.  My friends and I were unable to have a conversation without screaming, and I actually felt so anxious I felt sick, so we ended our meal as quickly as we could.  The hostess said, ""Oh, when the DJ is here we play music because people start dancing.""  When I asked where they could possibly find space to dance, she said, ""On tables, chairs, everywhere, you'll see!""  This sounded like my worst nightmare and was NOT ADVERTISED ON THEIR MENU OR ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT or I absolutely never would have brunched there.  Luckily, none of this dancing actually happened--people just carried on with their brunch like normal, except with incredibly loud music accompanying the meal.

Conclusion:  If you want to have a cute French place, have a cute French place.  Don't morph into a faux-club during Sunday brunch just because you're in the Meatpacking District.  It's not necessary, it's really weird, and it's borderline false advertising.",0
"I think it's funny that you can rate a McDonalds on yelp but here I go. First, before I begin, what did you all expect? Why expect so much from a 24 hour McDonald's?

To be honest, I'm ashamed to say I've come here like at least a dozen times because it's convenient. Mostly because it's the worst McDonald's I've ever been to in my life. It's insane how bad each experience is but yet I still give in when I crave those fries. Fries like crack.

The staff is laughably bad at giving off any sense of professionalism, they're almost all stoned teenagers who randomly shout during their constant conversations. The food usually looks like a 2 year old boy threw it together, the fries cold 75% of the time. I've gotten sick like 3 different times after eating here, there was a hair in my sandwich once, and the coffee is pure diarrhea in a cup. 

I worked at a fast food restaurant for my first job, and I can understand why this all goes on. There's no reason to expect anything really when you pay so little is how 99% of the staff is at McDonalds. Except for the ok ones in Manhattan. But even those suck still. I still don't understand the point of reviewing them... 1 or 2 stars max, no one gives a shit. People still go and always will, they knew what they were getting into when they chose to eat here.

Last note, crowd after 1 am is creepy and drunk.",1
"FLY IN FOOD!!!! I ordered to go fried chicken and ramen and the fried chicken came with a BIG FAT fly big as a nickel fried right into the batter of one of the pieces of chicken. Upon further inspection I realized the legs and abdomen had as well been fried into various other pieces of meat meanings the few bites I had already ingested contained pieces of the big fat (literally unreasonably large sized) fly. Needless to say I vomited several times until I felt dizzy and sick and called 311 to file a formal complaint. They are currently investigating and will contact me shortly for an interview. They have told me roughly 30 restaurants per week are shut down for immediate health and hygiene reasons and that this is a very likely candidate to be terminated. Do not ever eat here, imagine the type of kitchen that would allow large flies to regularly land on food being cooked.   You are not only potentially risking eating a fly in your meal but your are guaranteed to be eating the remnants of one from that day in one of the dishes or deep fryers used to cook all the meals. This is a textbook definition chain restaurant with a good taste but a cheap price and a cheap staff thrown into a high volume area. It will be shutdown and no person should risk eating out of a trash can in nyc that these flies buzz around. If you eat this restaurant you are literally eating off a ghetto projects dumpster.",1
"We always try to find a good place that features 'burgers and fries/BAR food' as their go-to dishes for usually, we are always acquainted with our best meals at such places. So, after Comic Con this year, we thought it would be interesting to walk up to this restaurant and try it out once and for all.

Environment 7/10: First off, it's a corner-of-the-block kind of place so it isn't hard to miss and the outdoor seating goes all around; always a nice touch and one that we took advantage of. The seating was surprisingly spacious enough for us two, as it sat for four, with all of our merch and bags from the convention. Depending on how you feel about the streets and people outside, you are fenced off but you still have the busy and noisy road right in front of you but like I said, depending how you are with noisy and loud surroundings with your meal, I say go inside but we were happy as is. The bathroom was amazingly clean and very spacious, with the sick being away from the toilet and 'relief utensils' as my uncle calls them so if you need to wash your hands, you can do that without holding up anyone who had finished their 'duty'.

Service 6/10: The service was very good and I have very little to argue in this category with my review. We were seated within 5-7 minutes, considering how crowded and busy the restaurant was. The server was very frequent with our requests: taking our orders, refills, check, etc. They were professional and formal and made our time pleasant. One thing that had gotten on our nerves at one point was toward the end of out meal, we eventually asked for the bill. While the server went back inside to retrieve our tab, we waited almost ten minutes. Figured while awaiting his return, I made my way to find the bathrooms. While turning around to get up, I peered into the establishment and caught our server just leaning and hanging out by the bar, talking with a fellow employee as well as what seemed to be a customer whom he could have possibly knew, Im not sure.What ever the case was, I wasn't happy having to wait for them on my way out because they chose to take a few minutes to themselves and hold us up from our plans. I can only imagine how many more times this happened.

Food Quality 6/10: Last but not least, the food. Merg had ordered a vegetarian dish, artichoke dip with cheddar tots, and I went with the buffalo chicken breast with fries aside from an order of beer pretzel sticks to split. My sandwich was without a doubt delicious as well as the fried that accompanied it but the sauce had been drizzled over it, rather than the sauce be all over the fillet. I can also assume that our waiter had struck up another conversation on the way to get our order because the sauce had gone a bit hard and slightly chilled instead of the intended hot. We both agree that the pretzel sticks were nice, crisp with a sweet and soft center. The downside was the dip; oily, runny, soggy and beyond garlicky for the mrs.; and that says a lot coming from a girl who kisses a guy who eats whole cloves of the stuff. Another element that bugged me was pricing. Now, I'm not saying that I didn't do my research on this place's affordability before I chose to attend it. But when I can order dishes at other places, one's that are cooked nicely as well as properly, and I can view other eateries literally right across the street from me when my eating experience isn't going so well, it truly does hurt my time spent at 5.N.B.

Overall: We will admit we did enjoy my time here considering the company and also with just how much fun we had that day with the comic convention and all but when it came to finally settling down from being on our feet all day and just relaxing to some 'up-scale bar food', we were a bit disappointed. With our leisurely server taking their time, the food's pricing, as well as it reputation not matching its expected quality, we were let down but at least we were full. Def check it out on a day where it isn't as busy, especially not a Friday evening during a major social event like NYCC. It could have potential and come a time where Merg and I are in the neighborhood again and have no other food joint to check out, we just may give it another go",0
"I woke yup the next morning with food poisining!!!  I had pastrami!!
I say it is not clean und is more like Nathans at Coney Island than a true Jewish Deli.

Better try another deli if you want a clear stomach the next day.  I was sickened from eating there!",1
"I can't believe I've only just now found this gem of a place near my apartment.  I was a little skeptical after seeing only 1 other party in the restaurant and the ghetto lighting figures they had hanging from the non-working chandeliers, but hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right?

Prices are on point for chicken combos - 2 sides and a quarter of a chicken for $6.50 or a half chicken for $8.50.  Portions are large as well - I ordered a half chicken and took half of it home.  Green sauce is delicious and the homemade hot sauce adds the perfect amount of kick to your dish.  Beans are hearty and rice is well cooked.  The chicken is also well-cooked and flavorful - not too dry.

I saw the mixed seafood ceviche for $14 had to have it. Though $14 seems like a steep price since my entree was basically half the price, it was totally worth it.  Squid, shrimp, and raw fish galore - no food poisoning here.  The simple spicy lemon marinade was to-die for.

One thing I noticed that was exceptional and that I must point out was the level of customer service here.  My dirty napkins were replaced, my water was always full, and someone came around to make sure I had enough green sauce.  They constantly came around asking if we needed anything else and if we were doing okay.  It's not everyday that you'll find this level of service around the City, and especially not at a $$$$ establishment.",0
"The calming cocoa smoothie is absolutely divine okay????!!!!?! I could chug two of those within 45 minutes. 

Also tried the granola fruit cocoa nib bowl it was better than expected. 

Sick.",0
"This place is amazing to party with the right company but there are some downfalls that outweigh all the the fun things here. First off, for a guy to pay $40 at the door is ridiculous. Knowing the promoter here will give you a discounted rate at 30 but still....Nevertheless, I gotta admit the music and the atmosphere (lights) here are pretty sick. You can really have a good time here, drinking and dancing.

However, since this is a basement lounge, the subwoofers in all corners are way too loud and no one in any groups can hear one another. Our ears were still ringing the next morning. On top of everything, the drinks are so damn pricey that it'll make anyone think twice if they want to get wasted here without pregaming.

On the brighter note, if you're a girl and your date/man is paying for you, take the free ride and enjoy the night cuz this place is sick to drink and dance to some amazing tunes. Guys on the other hand, with a heavy heart my friends, be prepared to pay that big fat check you'll expect to see that night.",0
"Um when eating from this restaurant I would avoid any dish that comes in goopy sauce i.e. ""pepper steak"" ""any meat w mushrooms"" ""any meat in black bean sauce"". They're pretty stingy so you won't even find crushed garlic in that sauce, just tasteless corn starchy brown oil goop. Did I mention oily? Yeah for some reason all the dishes in sauce are pretty goopy and OILY. So I suggest you stick with anything that is deep fried (i.e. chicken wings, scallops, fried wantons) as they cook at such a high temp that they absorb little eye or go with a chicken w broccoli or chicken w mixed vegetables. Also 9 times out of 10 the eggdrop soup is watered down. So um....I rarely eat here except when I get really really sick of everything else around here.",0
"If I could put minus 5 for this place I would! Disgusting!!! Never in my ten years of living in NYC has this ever happened to me!!!

I ordered delivery a few weeks back from them, and I had ordered delivery a few times before, never anything to write home about, but good for late night diner food. Me and a friend were excited for our food. I ate a bit of my tuna deluxe salad. Until I uncover this little cockroach in my coleslaw. I wasn't even too upset. Honestly I've been in the restaurant business for 16 years. Stuff happens. This has never happened to me before, although I've heard stories. What I was and am particularly upset with, and why I'm posting it is how the owner treated me after I called to tell them. He refused to say it came from them. Because I magically put the cockroach in and buried and it in my soggy coleslaw for a free $10 dish so I could argue with you about it for 20 minutes. He finally agrees rudely to a refund. But says I have to come in to swipe my card for a refund. My companion didn't eat his food either. We also had to order food from somewhere else and wait for it. I myself could not eat because I was sick to my stomach and had been upset. 

I go in and he's gone. And his sweet employee apologizes to me and says he's only authorized to refund me $10, when what we ordered was $28. I brought the food back with me. I decided to come back again an hour later when I knew he'd be there. When I went back in for my refund he again insulted me and said he did not care and did not believe the cockroach was from there and that I must have put it in my food! And that I am a naive little girl who doesn't know what she is doing. I don't care what he thinks this is not how you speak to customers! Especially when you are in the wrong. And I had many of my own thoughts about a man in his 80's who probably has had many interesting bias's from the early part of the century that don't really work with today any longer. This is why I am posting this.

 I honestly would not have put so much time and wasted energy into this if he had not been SOOOOOOOOO rude to me!!! I have never in my life been spoken to this way in a restaurant. This owner is a disgusting human being who needs to learn how to treat customers and other human beings. I will never go back here again. Needless to say I was upset. I called the health department on him the next day and made a complaint. I have a photo of the cockroach that I wish I could add to this review. I have worked in many restaurants over the course of 16 almost 17 years, ten of those years being in NY, and I've managed 3. I have never EVER spoken to or treated a customer the way he treated me! The cockroach was in my soggy coleslaw and I have a photo to prove it. If any one knows how to upload it please let me know. 

Regardless I HIGHLY recommend NEVER EVER going here!!! Neptune diner on Classon Ave is better, cheaper and also open 24 hours. Unless you want a similar experience to me...",1
"I stayed at this hotel about ten years and they had a lawless rooftop bar. A couple was openly banging in the corner. The bartender was too drunk to do anything. That's not this place anymore.

There was also a lobby bar in the Shelburne where I picked up an Asian call girl - va-va-voom! The only thing in RARE Bar you can pick up now is food poisoning. I luckily get to expense it. Ten years ago NYC was still a fun place.  Now every place is run by the schnozzolas.",1

"This restaurant needs alot work

I've eaten at this place a few times already, 2 of the 3 times I got sick. We always got half regular half spicy. We got a variety of meat n veggie. Tacky Chinese place. Service isn't the best and its really slow. I suspect they reuse the left over food that other customers don't eat. Never get the wings they greasy and have a freezer taste. Best part of the meal was prolly the shanghai soup dumplings 

If your here for ayce just to stuff yourself for the price $26 and it includes Budweiser then this place is for you",1
"I signed up for yelp just to write this review. I have passed his place a few times and since my usual shawarma place has been closed for a while I thought I would give it a try. I ordered a falafel sandwich and a lamb shwarma sandwich. I was halfway through the shawarma when I felt like I was going to be sick. A mad dash to the privvy led to  a half an hour of unpleasantness the likes of which I haven't seen in years. This place should be shut down. I got violently ill from the food and I want everyone to know it.
I gave this place one star because you can't give it no stars !!!!!",1
The service is good. The food was awful. I ordered a quesadilla. The cheese in it was old. The shrimp was from a frozen bag I noticed the cook open. I was sick afterwards. My wife went with a friend bout 2 weeks later and she got sick from it also and noticed her lettuce in her salad was brown and mushy. I feel bad the waitress's were do nice but food is awful.,1
"This place had so much potential, especially opening up in Washington Heights. I have now given Heights Tavern 5 shots. I've sat indoors and outdoors; come for drinks and dinner; come in the summer, fall, and winter; and had 4 different servers. Each visit was a disaster. 

The food here is actually decent, and it's such a nice and big space, so it's too bad that the service is the worst!

On my most recent visit, two friends and I stopped in for lunch around noon. The restaurant was mostly empty. Our waiter took down our very simple orders - turkey burger with sweet potato fries, regular burger well-done with fries, and BBQ crispy chicken wrap with salad. 

He came back a minute later, asking ""Did any of you want sides with your burgers/wraps?"" Really?

When our food came out, my friend's burger was done medium, and was missing the caramelized onions she had requested. We had to flag down our waiter to have him take the food back. By the time it came back out, me and our other friend had nearly finished our meals. Our waiter was perfectly polite and apologized, but what bugged me was that he blamed it on the kitchen. We just want an apology, not for you to blame it on someone other than yourself! It would have helped if he had then offered to give us a discount, or a gift card, but no such thing was offered. 

By the end of our meal we were so exasperated we just wanted to get out. It also didn't help that their tv's were on TNT, which was playing some sort of crime drama. ESPN would have worked just fine, but instead I had to gag on my turkey burger while watching a poor lady bite into a poisoned cupcake, then start vomiting massive amounts of blood on their huge flat screen tv's. 

Fool me once, shame on you. But Heights Tavern has now fooled me 5 times! Shame on me. Definitely not coming back.",0
"The first real coffee joint in K-Town. They use Sightglass beans from San Francisco for their espresso, and sell them as well. That makes this the only coffee place I know of in NYC that sells the best roasters I have so far come across in my life, though their own rendition is somewhat beset by very slight over-bitterness and lack of nuance, compared to SoMa's original. The space is very large and often delightfully available. Highly recommended, especially if you're sick of Stumptown three blocks down.
Open late for a coffee place. Hot dessert called Ho-dduk is like a real old-world fried donut filled with jam - very tasty.",0
"This place is amazing. Why? Because they actually do give you free sample cups and don't guard over the machines like you're going to destroy them and spit all over the valves. Which is surprising because there are so many kids in this place. But there aren't as many drunks. So I think that is why they let freedom reign in here. Flavors are pretty amazing and almost as good as 16 Handles. It's like a fraction of a mili-second away from being THAT good. But it gets five stars clearly because no one hassles you for taking more than 2 samples and the prices are significantly cheaper than 16 Handles. 

I love Fro-yo. It is a guilty, sick pleasure because I'm pretty sure I'm mildly lactose intolerant so I feel nauseous about 45 minutes later on a regular basis whenever I spring for a trip. But it is SO DELICIOUS. They had an apple cider yogurt that was great. The Cinnamon Bun one is quite great as well and the Pistachio. They also change flavors regularly so you never know what you're going to run into. Like Nyc Cheesecake and red velvet. It keeps rotating. They also give you spoons with Looney Toons characters on them! YES! Bugs Bunny for the win! Toppings are generic. You have various fruits and mashed up candy bars, chocolate chips, a variety of nuts and more chocolate, coconut, nilla wafers, graham crackers, etc. etc. Frozen yogurt is healthier than ice cream, so why the hell not. But this stuff is loaded down in sugar. Like ridiculous sick amounts of refined delicious sugar. Do yourself a favor and go now but don't hold me responsible if you and or your kids are running around in circles for hours and crash.",0
"I am super duper surprised I had never written a review for Kenka before! I've been here at least 10-15 times in my life dating back to 2007 and each experience never EVER disappoints! It's always fun to come with a group of friends, especially when their main objective is to drink. Now time to give the real rundown from all of my Kenka wisdom and pass it down to the next generation.

First, get here early! On weekdays (specifically M-Th), it usually doesn't get overly-crowded at the open at 6pm, but the crowd will build up FAST! You will usually get a seat if you get here by 6, but as the night progresses a wait builds up. As for weekends (specifically Friday and Saturday), the most popular days, there WILL be a crowd outside before 6pm, so get there early to put your name down if you don't want to wait. Small parties get in fairly quickly, but parties of 7+ can easily wait over an hour.

Once you get in, you will notice nude photos on the wall and other interesting artifacts. It's a nice touch that peeks the interests of the curious, especially when drunk. On the menu, there are definitely some interesting tidbits and rules you should be VERY AWARE of as the night goes on. Some of those rules include no vomiting on the premises, no sake-bombs, no fighting, etc....the usual right? Any broken rules result in a $20 fine, so get that wallet ready if you're going to drink till your liver explodes because I've actually had a friend break one of those rules and pay up.

If you're looking to celebrate and drink heavily, I highly recommend buying a bottle or a few bottles of the sake. Great way to lose your sobriety very quickly. In addition, there are the pitchers of beer you can get or for the more adventurous the ""snake shot"". YES ""snake shot""! There's an actual dead rattle snake inside the bottle they serve you with and it's some potent stuff. 

As for food, there's plenty to mention, but some of my favorites include the french fries (with ketchup and mayo) and anything chicken, just to keep it simple. If you're looking to challenge someone, then by all means order the bull penis and turkey testicles. Call it very bizarre as many will, but they actually are quite appetizing, if unappealing. However, if you're looking to ""eat"" here, maybe those 2 items shouldn't be on your mind.

If you do stay here all night till close to 4am (closing), which I have done on multiple occasions, be ready for the very intoxicated that are still there to entertain you as they (specifically the girls) bumble, stumble and possibly even make out in front of you. All in all, it's a fun place to be when you're looking for a night out on the town with the guys and gals!",0
Place changed ordered martini taste like they didn't clean the shaker fish had off taste next day sick as a dog no more Fiorentinos for me.,1
"This is the worst Thai food I have ever eaten. I'd rather eat dog food.  No tofu in the tofu Pad Thai.  Spring rolls taste like cardboard.  Mango and sticky rice look like amniotic sacs.  Chicken with garlic is breaded, soggy, and too garlicky.   The food made 2 members of our party sick to our stomach.  Do not eat here!!!!!",1
"Mai oh mai. This is was my very first Yelp event, UYE, but it turned out great. The place is on a strip of Ludlow, where there seems to be a lot of hipsters. The restaurant really isn't that big but it is a long restaurant. On the night we went, it was brick outside, so it was relatively slow, but great for our party since we were probably the loudest people there lol In terms of food, I think the small plates were the clear winners. Also, the Ginga Kogen, which is like Hefe Weizen, is exceptional. It's according to the table as very ""refreshing."" 

The food:

Egg on Egg on Egg- sea urchin, sturgeon caviar over a bed of scrambled eggs. This dish kinda signified everything good and holy in this world. LOL The dish was good, but I feel the scrambled egg with a slight kick from the Uni were the predominant flavors. I barely noticed the caviar at all. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=spQBVg_hNazyU1sV6vuSqw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Tsukune- chicken meat ball, foie gras with poached egg. I am a sucker for Japanese chicken meat balls and this is one of the best I ever had. The inside was perfectly juicy and so tender. The taste with the poached egg went great. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0JfVJijhAHtO__Y2QZ2L4w&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA 

Foie Gras Chawan Mushi- foie gras egg custard with a dashi glaze. I was SHOCKED how much I liked this dish, I didn't even bother taking a pic of it when I first saw it since, I didn't expect to like it. It was SO FREAKIN good. I thought it was going to be blah, oh no it wasn't.

Uni Crostini- torched uni and Parmesan Reggiano flakes. As much as I liked this dish, I felt like it was kinda cheating. Torched Uni on anything woulda made it good. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TR6cftV9yLRF6GdwYrqKTg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Secreto Iberico Pork- Farro salad with kogashi shoyu. I don't really eat farro but I really liked it. The pork was cooked nicely, but I do wish it was slightly more tender. For some reason, the pork reminded of skirt steak. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dZgqgSRwBR3Zttud0t-Hmg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Pork Bun- braised Mugi Fuji pork belly and Gua bao bun. Meh, they were OK, at least they didn't put lettuce in it(I hate lettuce in my pork buns) I felt like the pork was missing the fattiness and it was slightly chewier that what I was expecting. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4k7KZEmEsZ-ICkCY9z4wzQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Octopus- pickled celery, zucchini and shio kombu. I thought this dish was nice, the octopus was nice and tender. The dish is served cold and the zucchini works nicely. 

Burgundy Truffle & Market Vegetables- string beans, snap peas, butternut squash, radicchios, endives in a truffle soy vinaigrette. I thought this dish was a little odd that it was cold. Guess I was expecting it to be hot. The massive chunks of truffle are pretty sick though. It was a nice dish, but not a wow dish.

Daikon Mochi- bacon, Miyabi nori with wasabi pickled Kyoto greens. This dish was not my fav, this dish really reminded me of Spanish arepitas. I wasn't crazy about the texture nor the flavor. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uBwKnP-10cA88xO1WzJTXA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA 

Miso Black Cod- Japanese mushrooms, Bol choy with a orange reduction. It's a pretty dish, but I was kinda disappointed. This is kinda the go to dish for modern Asian places and it was just OK for me. I wasn't impressed with the orange rind or orange reduction. The taste of the fish was slightly off putting and the glaze was kinda too sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zVM_SNj1IiFlYWRMAmroMg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Bronzino Confit- Yuza creamed collard greens, daikon, red radish and mentai yogurt. Another pretty dish, too bad the visual was all from the radish. This dish was just OK for me as well. The fish was OK, but I wasn't a fan of the collard greens or the radish or anything now that I think about. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xEVT1-P8Rx5hcNuXVT8GjQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA",0
Disgusting. I ordered their chicken and veggies soup for delivery... I'm less than 2 blocks away but I was sick and couldn't pick up. The soup came within 20 min but was barely lukewarm... And the only remnants of chicken was ONE disgusting piece of chicken skin. You read that correctly. There was no chicken in my soup except for a piece of chicken skin.,0
"Dude. I came here for a birthday brunch bc my friend had a reservation. Got seated in the far back- an enclosed area practically outdoors. Saturday brunch, place is packed... but where we are is just freezing cold. I see thermostats and vents.. and one small space heater which I'm pretty sure is just a sick joke. My feet are freezing. I got the endless brunch... Bloody Mary's and I ordered the heart stopper- hangar steak, poached eggs and 'crispy bacon and onions'. My bacon was limp and my steak was cold. Fries were not crisp. The first bloody Mary had a lemon wedge and every one after didnt. Our waitress had a great attitude but she seemed overwhelmed. Dude all I gotta say is my balls are freezing and I didn't take off my winter coat the entire time I was here.",0
"Good - The food is greasy but it tastes good. The portions are huge. 

Bad - In the 10 or so times I've order from here, one time there was a green caterpillar in the steamed vegetables (dead) and another time there was what looked like a thin wood splinter, about 2 inches long in the lo mein, or maybe a bristle. 

It actually seems pretty clean in there for a Chinese takeout place, I've seen them scrubbing the cook surfaces down with soap and steel wool, and they have an A grade (http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchDetails.do) with 7 points, which is very low, whereas M Noodle got 63 last inspection, which is like a C grade, but it looks cleaner on the outside so you might not realize it. (Even Per Se has 7 points).

Anyway, I'm giving 2 stars because this is the second time there's been something weird/inedible in my food, but I'll prob order again in 4-6 months when I get an insatiable craving for Chinese takeout . The food tastes pretty good and you probably won't get sick eating it!",0
"I didn't plan to hook up last night, but this place kind of draws you in and keeps you there, late late into the nite. 

My friend and I ordered about 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. They were out of a few things I wanted so I ended up getting the steak. My friend got something fancier - some pasta seafood dish i think with something I can't pronounce and wouldn't eat anyway. 

I get the impression this place does the basics really well. Like you can't really screw up a good steak and if you do you're a mental midget and shouldn't be working in a professional kitchen anyway. Mine was cooked perfectly - seriously seared on the outside and just raw in the center. Plus their fries are ADDICTIVE.

My friend's dish on the other hand was mushy and bland. Didn't even come close to finishing it. So it goes. 

Drinks are right on. Started with two martinis - stiff and large with an olive, not a twist. Then we moved on to some aperitifs while we headed for the pool table. That's when this place actually gets fun. There's a late night energy here that really seems to take off once the more polite diners vacate and the thrill seekers arrive. The DJ is this hot spinster who knows her shit and can even make a party happen with ancient Michael Jackson tracks.

The pool table crowd knows how to play. After about an hour there was a real sense of camaraderie and we were buying each other drinks and grubbing smokes etc. 

I met this amazing artist girl with the sweetest eyes and we just hit it off for some reason. By 1am my friend had to go since she needed to work in the morning. So I stuck around with the new chick while the two guys we were playing against challenged us to kiss. She didn't even flinch. She was on me immediately  - we were so in the moment - just a three second kiss, nothing too overt. And the guys were cool about it and not dogs.

We were pretty drunk but not stupidly so. It was 3am. The manager turned up the lights and gently kicked us out. We were walking down Front Street and I assumed she was taking the F like me. So I turned right toward the subway but she grabbed my hand and pulled me straight telling me she lived in Vinegar Hill and to just ""come on"". 

It was dreamy the whole experience. The next morning we woke up, both mealy mouthed, hung over with that pasty feel that's kind of gross but slovenly comforting at the same time. My new friend looked into my eyes and said, 'The Burger'. What do you mean? 

""I need 'The Burger'. Superfine. They make the best burger."" ""But we were just there. ""The Burger... The Burger.... she just kept repeating it over and over. 

We cuddled for a while and had lazy, hungover sex. It was snowing outside. The kind of day you just want to stay home and make eggs and coffee in bed. And I thought of how so many other people right at that moment were having mealy mouthed, pasty lazy sex and copulating. The idea of the whole neighborhood copulating simultaneously made me feel really gross - people I'd never want to copulate with all doing the same thing I was doing, having lazy sex, copulating and talking about brunch. It suddenly made the night before less unique.

I told her I hated brunch. She replied,  ""The Burger"". 

Fast forward 30 minutes - yeah the burger is efffin fantastic. Perfection on a bun. After their burger and two pint sized bloody marys - the best I think I've had despite there being no celery - my hangover was gone.

Fully satisfied, considering ordering a beer, I took a closer look at my surroundings. There they were. All the people from the night before. Pasty. Pale. Hungover. It made me feel sad and I started feeling sick.

It's a good place if you're looking for adventure, but I think I've had my share of fun here. I think I'm done with superfine.",0
They messed up my order. I didn't order food poisoning. Awful.,1
Food poisoning from steak and cheese. Looking forward to the 5 lb weight loss from being this sick,1
"a last minute decision to stop in and try s'mac, a place i've been wanting to try because of all the good things i've heard from my friends

they have a good amount of recommended macs and cheese combinations that definitely sound interesting - buffalo chicken, masala etc

you can also order your mac and cheeses with multi-grain or gluten free pasta, a nice touch if you have dietary requirements

if you don't like any of the recommendations, you can let your creative culinary taste loose and make your own

there was a decent amount of beers on tap here and bottled beer - mostly craft beers which is bonus points in my book as i prefer this then your typical brands such as coors light

i opted to order the regular 4 cheese dish thinking ""hey this place is known for mac and cheese (hence the name of the place) so their basic dish should be awesome"" - this is where it went downhill for me

a lot more cheese in this then i like, at some point it felt like i was just eating melted cheese and no mac - don't get me wrong, i like cheese a lot but not in a liquid form in this big of an amount

the high point of my meal was my beer, ommegang witte - a light, easy drinking beer

i really wanted to like this place and walked in with high hopes, but left disappointed and bit sick from all the cheese and not enough mac",1
"Avoid at all costs. Just finishing up brunch, extremely poor service, food not fit for dogs, and wearing a winter coat because the garden is simply a plywood box of the poorest construction. Not only was the food cold but there's snow falling on to plate. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. Ordered crab cakes and I feel the good poisoning coming on as I write this!",1
"No stars should be given. Do not eat here. The food made me sick. The service was horrible and the food was mediocre. The coffee mug was dirty, the dishes were not clean. Do not eat here.",1
"I was craving Sichuan food and decided to order from here since the reviews on Yelp seemed like it was decent.I ordered the egg drop soup, scallion pancakes, mapo tofu and the sauteed spicy aromatic shrimp. The overall experience was painful and disgusting.The soup was bland and was not cooked long enough that all the ingredients tasted raw and the liquid was gooey. The scallion pancakes were OK but did not have enough flavor to them. The mapo tofu was delicious and the tofu tasted fresh. The worst dish was the sauteed aromatic shrimp which was mouth numbing experience. The color of the dish was brown and looked over cooked. My boyfriend and I were so hungry at that point thatwe decided to give it a go. The minute we ate this our mouths started to go numb and the taste was as if they had poured gasoline in the dish. I understand some of it might be the spice but I've had enough Sichuan style food that I know what it should taste like. After we ate this, our bodies started to tingle and we felt nausea for about 4 hours. I looked up these symptoms and it's the case of over using MSG. There was SO MUCH MSG used in this dish that my body had a reaction to it instantaneously. I called the restaurant and the lady was nice enough to credit us but what rubbed me the wrong way was that she insisted that it was my first time trying this dish and that I had nothing to compare it by. I've let her know that I've had enough Sichuan food to understand the deeply rooted flavors but nothing should numb the mouth and gives your body a nauseous reaction. This could also be a case of a dirty kitchen and staff who may not have cleaned their ingredients properly. I really had high expectations for this place, but I will never go back after this experience. I understand in NY, most restaurants use MSG but this was a case of over using and making a customer very sick.",1
"THIS RESTAURANT IS A SERIOUS HEALTH HAZARD! I came to grab a late night meal so I bought a cheesesteak with fries. It was a decent meal and I left satisfied but a little bloated. EIGHT HOURS LATER I WAS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM! I was up all night with severe food poisoning and had to call an ambulance when it came to the point that I couldn't move ten steps without vomiting. The hospital put me on an IV as a source of hydration while I waited out the diagnosed gastroenteritis, which is caused by poorly prepared food or contaminated water (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis). New York has incredibly high standards for its water quality - it doesn't take much to guess what the cause was.

My cheesesteak and fries caused me to lose SEVEN POUNDS and gave me a fat bill from the ER. Don't eat here. Ever.",1
"My wife and I had eaten here a few times before without incident last night was totally different. 

We had the standard market salad and I had pad see ew with chicken and she had pad see ew with vegetarian duck and we both became violently ill.  

I barely made it home without going to the bathroom in my pants, and my wife was up throwing up with diarrhea all night long. 

I can't imagine that it was anything other than food poisoning. If anyone else ate there on December 13 I hope you didn't have the same experience I'd have to imagine that it was restaurant wide.",1
"The chicken in the Cesar salad was gelatinous and had no texture. The wings were lukewarm and just ok tasting, definitely not living up to the hype. The meal was followed by upset stomachs and essentially food poisoning... Never again.",1
"Rafiqi's fools you once, shame on Rafiqi's. Rafiqi's fools you twice, shame on YOU!

Seriously guys, don't let this place lure you in with its bottom dollar prices and its ""how bad can it be? it's street food!"" charms. I honestly had a day of my life ruined after eating their gyro on rice, as I prayed that the sodium-fueled storm brewing in my stomach wouldn't turn out to be food poisoning. You will regret this decision. You've been warned.",1
"I was really disappointed.  After all the hype, I expected to be in burger heaven but I found the food to be overly greasy and oily.  I have never left a place feeling sick, especially after having burgers and fries...but I really did not have a good experience.  Go to Five Guys ... cheaper and tastes so much better!",1
"The worst. The worst bar none. It pains me because it's so close to my house, but I can no longer go there. 

The management of the pharmacy is terrible. Not only have I been sent home with the wrong prescription, but when I returned it they were not apologetic in the least. (I fear to think what might have happened were I am old person, or sick, or not paying attention.)

The staff is harried, disorganized and incompetent. They struggle to find prescriptions, make customers call out their names and birthdays. Forget the twenty minute wait just to pick up a prescription.

For a full month they strung me along saying they'd ordered a drug for me--nothing special, easily filled elsewhere but Rite Aid is so close to me and my favorite pharmacy Health AId closed--that  finally I had to take the prescription back because it was about to lapse. It was filled within an hour at Neergard on 7th.

The pharmacist was so upset she said the management of the pharmacy was terrible, she was afraid given the slipshod way the place was run that she could lose her license. Not to mention the fact that she was paid less than at her old pharmacy job. 

Now that a new pharmacy has opened up on 7th Avenue between 6th-7th streets--in the space Health Aid occupied--I am filling my prescriptions there.",0
"Great burger joint. Fries were cooked to perfection. The sweet potatoe fries were on mark.  The burgers are so juice be careful when you bite in to them...you might burn your fingers. Good pitcher deals and mug drafts. Swing on by for some surf music or bond theme songs.

Later that night, my friend got sick from his burger. It had to be something he had there because he didn't eat anything else after and before that it was around 2pm. I really liked the cheese burger I had. He had the bistro burger that was basically the same as mine but with lots of bacon. Hopefully it was a fluke. If anyone has had any bad food at this establishment please let me know.",1
"What a sick joke. Just took me an hour and a half before I got my burger, and when I asked politely how much longer it would be the waitress gave me a terrible attitude. 2 families who sat after us received their meals, ate them and left before we even got ours. Not only was the burger absurdly average, the lettuce tomato and onions all looked like they had been sitting in a freezer for 3 years. The burger was 14 dollars and the flat, warm soda was 3 dollars... What a waste of time and money.",0
"I love pizza, but this pizza is horrible. I can't take more than a few bites without feeling sick, I don't know how people eat it. It tastes like tasteless plasticky cheese on cardboard. The only thing they have going on is the jumbo slices, which I think is why people eat it thinking they're getting more for their money or something. If you can eat this you can eat anything. And if you think this is good pizza, you don't know anything about pizza.",0
"After ordering, an acquaintance and I couldn't find any seats, probably because it was a Saturday. We ended up taking our food and walking to a park just to find a place to eat. I took a bite, and I liked it, until I realized that the burger was medium rare, though they didn't ask me how I liked it. I didn't even know they made it any different. I hesitated to continue eating, since I had never had a medium rare burger before, but I continued eating it because it tasted great. 

Afterwards, feeling satisfied with a meal that I liked, we walked around for a bit, but then I wanted to go home because I just started feeling real sick, nausea and stomach cramps. Not sure if it were the burger or what, but I guess you should tell them how you want your burger when you order.",1
"Never eat here! Stopped here for dinner with my boyfriend after several recommendations and ended up with a terrible experience and FOOD POISONING.

My bf got the lasagna, and I got the veal osso buco. The manager/owner Joey was very friendly, and the house Chianti was tasty. That's where any good experience ended.

The food arrived quickly - too quickly. Seven minutes of wait time isn't even enough to heat precooked food up in the microwave. The veal was tender, but exceptionally bland. The risotto was the worst I've ever had. It was soupy and flavorless. When we complained, Joey offered us some gnocchi, which was, if possible, worse. The pasta was overcooked, and the brownish sauce on top was unidentifiable. Topped off with some Kraft parmesan cheese, it was a plate full of nasty.

The lasagna was steaming hot. The noodles were overcooked. The cheese on top was barely melted, however, and the meat and sauce combination, tasted mediocre and came with a side of thirty six hours of gastrointestinal upset.

The only other positive comment I have, is that they didn't charge extra for the food poisoning.",1
"I was visiting a friend in the neighborhood and wedecided to make dinner at his place rather than go out. We both had a craving for seafood and got the idea in our heads for stuffed squid, so we headed here.

This market doesn't have quite the kind of warmth or personality you might want from a neighborhood business. But that said, I've never seen a small fish shop like this one that was so clean. Everything was tantalizingly fresh looking and the prices were affordable. It makes the thought of shopping at Trader Joe's for seafood kind of a sick joke when you have a place like this nearby. I live in the UWS and even I have a hard time getting seafood this fresh and clean.

The squid for example was pearly white and impeccable.  I'd never seen squid so - perfect and thoroughly cleaned

We picked up chorizo from Paisano's on Smith Street - which was stunningly delicious and made stuffed squid was better than any squid I've had at any restaurant. (It helps that my friend's an amazing chef.)",0
"Let's Start with the lady who picks up the phone and gives attitude when asking normal decent questions about pricing.

The sushi doesn't taste good, it tastes old, not fresh at all, I wouldn't recommend going here for sushi, the spicy tuna didn't taste good at all. Waste of money in my opinion

Plus I got food poisoning, this place is really not clean at all. Deserve negative stars",1
"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE unless you want food poisoning.  I would give zero stars if that were possible.  The food took an hour to arrive, was cold, disgusting and inedible when it finally did arrive, and I threw up from the small amount that I did eat.  When I called the restaurant to see if there was anything they could do and to let them know, they hung up on me.  I repeat, DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.  The food is terrible and they do not care about customer service.",1
"I live in the neighborhood and have been to veggies several times.  The juice has always been just OK.  They don't use the freshest vegetables and fruit and none of it is organic so, like other reviewers, I'm not sure why the prices are so high.  

This leads me to my next point--that the last time I went, I'm sure that I got FOOD POISONING from their juice.  I had a juice with spinach and kale in it.  I knew I should have been more careful when I saw the guy putting some browning spinach leaves into the blender.  The juice wasn't even that great and within a few hours I was throwing up.  I'm very health conscious and aware of my body so I know that this juice is definitely the culprit, I had been feeling fine and not really eaten much else that day.  Sure it's in a convenient location but not worth the risk.",1
Noooooooooo!!!! I had sushi here and afterwards we to rush home because me my fiancé and bro n law all got sick and had to run to the bathroom! Don't eat here! The food isn't fresh! No STARS!,1
"Pretty sure I got a mild case of food poisoning after eating here last night. I ate the pickles on the table, a hot pastrami sandwich and a side of potato salad. It was crowed and the services was blunt but the food tasted good while I was eating there. Around midnight I didn't feel well at all and lets just say the meal didn't stay in my stomach all night. 

It's definitely a unique, fun place (although a bit on the expensive side) but based on my experience, I won't go back.",1
"When you suffer from food poisoning on the night after eating at a place, you know that restaurant won't be getting good reviews. 
The caesar salad I had tasted decent until I actually got to the chicken--which tasted severely undercooked, or like chicken from a can. That probably should have tipped me off.
My boyfriend had wings, which I tried a little bit of and was not impressed. 
Pretty much nothing tasted fresh, and the only good part about the experience is that it wasn't expensive. Except that, you know, I'd rather not pay any money at all for something that makes me incredibly sick.
So yeah never ever coming here again--diners, beware!",1
"Sick as he'll, I dragged my ass into the city to take care of some business. Found myself down in The Village (there is only one as far as I'm concerned) in need of some palliative care for my cold. I stopped in to Bee's Knees for a cup of tea and was treated to a wonderful cup of mint tea (perhaps the best cup of tea I've ever tasted!), use of the restroom (which might not have been open to the public...but I might have looked just that pathetic) and a gratis dose of aromatic herbs to help clear my head (nothing illicit of course). What a great place!  If you find yourself down around that neck of the woods make sure you drop by and get yourself a coffee, tea or tasty treat (everything looked soooooo good!).",0
"me definitely thinks not.
i'll keep it short and simple:
1- sushi was not fresh, it was very mushy.
2- waitress was rude and refused to write down our orders and we had to tell her 3 times!
3- 1/2 of us got sick from it the next day.
4- warm sake did NOT taste good.
pros:
1- free red bean icecream was yum.
2- cucumber/pickle was refreshing and crunchy.",1
"My friend and I came here after her fantasizing about how amazing the dumplings are here. I'd heard that Vanessa's was a dumpling force to be reckon with through other sources as well so I was keen to see what it was all about.

My friend, being a dumpling fanatic in general, ordered three different kinds of dumplings and the duck pancake. We dug in, and as she sank her teeth into the pancake she mentioned how it tasted a little ""off"". I decided to skip it, being that I don't really eat meat in general. We finished everything and went on our way. I wasn't mesmerized by the experience but I was impressed by how popular this joint was. At 7 p.m. it was already jam packed. I also liked the Bring Your Own Beer aspect (there needs to be more of that in NYC).

That night, my friend and I went to bed and at 2 a.m. she became violently ill. She spent the entire night vomiting up dumplings, sour meat and alcohol and unfortunately forever altering her love affair in a long standing relationship with dumplings. Food poisoning is the last thing you want on a trip. I'm sorry Vanessa's - but it's a no, no.",1
The food is maybe 50% fresh.i worked in food business for years and know how a good station is set up. Taking a bag of frozen shrimp out of the freezer and putting them in warm water for a few minutes and then cooking it on a flattop isn't safe let alone the proper say to defrost food. Worse case is it got me sick. Dirty lettuce I'm sure isn't the freshest ingredient either. I hope this all changes cause I live close and think the concept and options are good. My opinion is get a chef in their that knows right from wrong and maybe I'll go back.,1
"Pretty sure these are the cheapest, tastiest hot dogs you will ever eat in your life! I definitely came here at 4am so i might be a little biased since I came super drunk but believe me I ate the house down! I had the chili dog, corn dog, spicy sausage, and chili cheese fries. Everything was ridiculously good! The crazy thing is I didn't even feel sick the next day which is a major plus in my book! Will def make this my drunk eating place everytime i visit NY.",0
"A great cozy warm place, especially when it is raining or snowing outside.  Very convenient to the theaters and very reasonably priced. The atmosphere brings out the customers friendly side.  

The best French Onion soup I have ever tasted.  The menu is a great selection of Irish food, however; the food must not always be prepared by the same chef.  Sometimes the food is cooked to perfection and other times it's uneven and just not quite right.  Ex:  the tuna sandwich is usually one if my favorites that I like medium rare.  However last week it was rare in the middle and burnt on the outside.  Probably cooked under too high of heat. 

The hostess is cute ass hell, but isn't very friendly.  Everyone else is great and they are a true Irish crew.  

Unfortunately there are a lot of bad Irish Pubs in NYC (JP Moran's, I still get sick even thinking about that place), however; O'brien's will not disappoint.",0
"Some people see this hole in the wall as a simple, cheap eatery that serves up cheap roasted meats over rice. I, on the other hand, see a life time of dedication and skill. 

The store front is pretty hard to miss. If it wasn't for the constant line that can stretch out the door and down the block, I would not have found it myself. Don't let that line discourage you; your patience will be rewarded. 

From dawn until dusk. this team of 2+ serves up some of the best roast pork and duck on this side of Chrystie Street. Just be patient: this couple takes their job - and - their domain seriously. ""She"" works the morning noodles, ""he"" works everything meaty from taking your order, to chopping your meat, to packing, the taking your payment. The most bang for your buck is the two roasted meats over rice (usually roast pork and duck for me) for $5. I also go for the roasted meats by the pound (extra ginger/garlic sauce please!) when I'm looking to stock up.

But of course, there are some opportunities here. One thing I'm not super excited about is the roast pig. It's only made in small batches and is rarely as crisp as I'd like it to be. And then there's the level of cleanliness that always makes me a little nervous. With only two in the front of the house, it is purely impossible for any cleaning to happen during the day. Fortunately I never got sick.

Come with some patience. Just don't come hungry... or you'll just end up cranky from the wait.",0
"This place is extremely overpriced and the customer service is a little cold.  I can get the same-quality food at Wholefoods for cheaper.  Their sandwiches are not bad.  My favorite is the veggie burger.  Their chocolate brownies are also good, but expensive for a pastry.  Avoid the buffet if you can.  The food gets cold fast and I know people who got sick from eating it.  If you're going to eat here, stick with a sandwich or panini.  Otherwise, find someplace less expensive instead.",0
Absolutely disgusting.  If I had not been so hungry I would not have eaten anything.  I choked down the rubber shrimp with a cocktail sauce that had to be at least a year old.  The French onion tasted like a toxic bouillon soup with no onions.  I was burping that diarrhea tasting soup for 48 hrs.  Needless to say I will not be returning.,0
"On a cold, snowy morning, a young woman woke up feeling a little sickies. What more could she want than some of her ima's (mother in hebrew) chicken soup. Since that wasn't possible, because ima is aaaalllll the way in a far away land called New Jersey, Mendy's was the next best option. 
Apparently I was out of the delivery range, so the owner drove out my delivery on his own. Tried to give him an extra tip but he refused. 
Soup hit the spot. So did my schnitzel and knish. Extra points for great customer service. Thank you!",0
"3.5 

I would say the theme of the dinner was truffle! I was not complaining. Came here with  a group and we got to sit at a round table which was perfect. The meal started off with complimentary bread that came with an herb aioli. This was a decent start. There were six of us and we shared the shellfish platter for four. There was tuna, crab claws, and shrimp that were all fresh and tasty. I sampled my boyfriends pumpkin soup that had shavings of truffle on it and it was delish. For entree, I had the wild striped bass which was my least favorite part of the meal. It smelled fishy and tasted fishy. I ate half and thankfully did not get sick. It came with cabbage that had truffle on it so that made up for the smelly fish. Some side dishes that I sampled were the creamed spinach, truffle parmesan fries and mac and cheese. All of these sides were good except I wish the fries were crispier. For dessert, we shared two orders of the ice cream mini cones and the birthday cake. The birthday cake was the star. It was so whimsical looking with a caramelized piece of sugar that had sprinkles inside and cupcake frosting on it. It also had rainbow fruit loop looking pieces on it that just made the dish really pretty. The restaurant itself is gorgeous which made it a special dinner.",0
"I was so excited when I realized that there was a relative to my fav Thai Son down on Grand! Then, I went in and ordered my usual dishes: Pho and Grilled pork and spring rolls over vermicelli. 

I was appalled. 

The jumbo pho came with more noodles than I thought could fit in the bowl. It was served with minimal goodies (omosa, tendon, etc) in a bland as crap stock. Seriously, even chili and hoisin sauces combined didn't help. The grilled pork and spring rolls.. tasted........unlike what I've come to expect from Thai Son. We couldn't even finish our meals.

The best part of it all (not) was getting sick from the food.

Sad. So sad.",0
"I thought Ilili was very good. In particular, I was impressed with the fresh, rich, smokey flavor of the baba ganoush and hummus which put it this food just a notch above your typical lower priced middle eastern restaurant. 

In addition, the whole fish cooked in mustard sauce was excellent. Chicken kabobs tasted very slightly underdone, but they were seasoned well and we didn't get food poisoning, so, I can't really complain. 

The little square falafel were a nice touch and our dessert of light airy filo in a bird's nest pattern encircling rich creamy mousse + rose water was unique and well worth the extra calories.

Ilili has a stylish soothing ambience and seems like it would be a good place to go on a date.

It's worth mentioning that this meal was completely comped for me and as a result I cannot fully comment on the value. That being said, in my experience this type of cuisine is easy to come by - good quality for reasonable prices throughout the city. 

I got the impression that our bill was somewhat high (food, not liquor) and I generally don't like to splurge on cuisines that are easily accessible. It's akin to P.F. Chang's - the food is alright, but why bother when you can get excellent (and more authentic) Chinese food in China town for next to nothing.

In sum, I'd happily go back to Ilili but wouldn't splurge and would focus on the more exotic dishes that are unique to Ilili.",0
"The best food chain around! 

Soup fits every season and with Hale and Hearty's changing menus, you can't possible get sick of soup! Pour in some addicting crackers and you are set.

Great staff. You can sample as many as you like and they won't judge! Not even the slightest eyebrow raise. 

The only downside is the price. It is pricey compared to other locations for soup.",0
"This is hands down the worst dining experience of my life. My boyfriend and I were going to eat at Buttermilk Channel but due to a wait, and no room at the bar we decided to go next door for a drink. Although it was against my better judgement my boyfriend suggested that we stay at Mezcal for dinner. What a mistake.

The bartender barely made eye contact and took no interest in us or our experience while making a strong and undrinkable margarita with cheap sour mix. We told him that we wanted to move out to the outdoor seating area for dinner and when we did we sat there for 15 minutes with no service, no menus, no water until I asked a 10 year old boy for menus. It was probably another 20 or more before anyone took our order. Despite having asked for the salad first it was another 30 minutes until we received our food. The salad was not dressed, the spicy shrimp dish was so spicy that it was flavorless and barely edible, and the seafood in the other dish was overlooked and bland. The waitress didn't come to ask us how things were for at least 20 minutes at which point we both felt sufficiently ill and just wanted to leave. Despite having asked for a check another 10 minutes went by at which point we went to the bar for our check. The check totaling $75 for two margaritas, guacamole, and two entrees was a slap in the face for such shitty service and terrible Mexican food. Furthermore my boyfriend and I spent the night feeling horribly sick. In retrospect if we hadn't wanted to leave so quickly because we felt so sick I might have asked for a manager. 

Save yourself and avoid this restaurant at all costs.""",1
"I wish I could give zero stars here. I have been here twice. I should have learned the first time. I got food poisoning BOTH times. I, however, have a policy in forgiving a single incident and chalking it up to an isolated incident. Obviously not the case here and shame on me for giving them the second shot. When I confronted the owner about the issue, he basically told me to F*** off and just go somewhere else to eat. I will and I think EVERYONE should.",1
Got food poisoning after my last visit.  Not fun!,1
"""CONS:
*Revolting food -- and I do mean that in a literal sense. It gave me food poisoning. I'm not sure how food that greasy was also so bland. I would have expected (and accepted) a heavy hand with seasoning. 
*Service was non-existent. We went through the entire meal with no water refill; we actually asked for and received our check from the host while he fussed over the wait-list clipboard. The only time we saw our waitress was the very beginning when she took our order and then brought it to the table. 

No points, Yakitori Taisho.""",1
"Yes it was delivery at 2am but I don't expect to get food poisoning the next day.

The food is very average at BEST.   Their cooking is very average.  their delivery speed is uber slow.   not the best place to go.",1
"""I used to really like this place it was like a much better version of chipotle. Just went last Tuesday was running errands and wanted to get some tacos. 

I got the pick two. I chose chicken tacos and a steak burrito bowl. When assembling the chicken tacos they barely put 1 ounce of chicken in one then in the other one they just drizzled the tortilla with chicken grease and tiny pieces of chicken. I asked them to please add a small piece of chicken at the very least make it even. There was literally the equivalent of a 1/2 inch cube of chicken in that small taco. They said they couldn't that was their policy. The young lady was very nasty about it and did not look happy to be there. I could've gotten more at taco bell instead I opted for a fresher more gourmet qdoba.

So I sit down and take one bite of the taco with chicken in it. COLD. Not fresh been left out and rubbery. The pico de gallo was frozen. So their fresh ingredients are anything but fresh. The burrito bowl also had cold steak on it. I decided to just eat the rice and beans. 

Later during the day I started to feel nauseous. I felt like throwing up. Well that was Tuesday. I'm actually on vacation this whole week and have been sick for most of it. So I wasted my time off. 

They should take better care in the way they handle food. I would've never thought I'd get sick from Qdoba. I hope they make the adjustments they need, both with their rude workers as well as with their food quality. Not for me, as I will never go back to this location.""",1
"""I ate here at 4 p.m today, I have food poisoning......so thanks for that.

I had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on, it was about 95 in there, the employees are sitting around fanning themselves, or asleep. yes asleep at the tables. 

these things alone, upon walking in...I usually would have left, but I was right by work and had little time....so I decided to give the sushi a chance.

Wish I hadn't. I knew by the first bite it was to warm, and kind of squishy....also it's flavorless....if I took a bite not knowing what it was, I could have never told you it was salmon. strange. I ate it bc I was hungry.....then I ordered a yellow tail scallion roll, i figured, you cant mess that up, and it was only 4$...... well I ate one bite, knew it wasn't good, ate one more bite....and was like NO. No more. It was TERRIBLE. and hot, and mushy....not even sticking together......i knew i'd be sick later, and I was right.

The only good thing, the bartender was really sweet.
But based on the fact I have food poisoning, Im gonna have to stick with 1 star and tell you not to eat here.""",1
"We came here after a tour around wall st. And thought this place looked pretty good. I had the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had a burger.

"""Touristy so don't feel you need to wear your Choo's for dinner despite the location. I have seen out of town business types eat while surfing the web on the laptop they bring to dinner with them, and really frompy overweight weight tourists in flip flops here.  Bottom line: this isn't one of THOSE UES bistro's so don't bother bringing out your finest. 

The menu is somewhat limited, salads and meats from all animals. Didn't see mussels or omelets or even steak tartare that you would find in most other bistro's. The wine menu was disappointing and not very sophisticated. We had to send the first bottle of Burgundy back because I've had vinegar that were less tart. 

They have 4 small tables in the front if you're into outdoor dining. 

Food:
Appetizer: we had the truffel mac and cheese which was very good, and the lobster salad which featured a tough, chewy, overcooked chunks of lobster. For $24, I thought the latter was overpriced considering the portion and flavor. Oh, they forgot to put the bacon in the mac and cheese which would have made it even better. 

Main course: Sea bass and Branzino - both came with some veggies like roasted tomatoes that went bad threw days ago, and bland boiled fingerling potatoes. Everything was swimming in BUTTER. 

I walked out of their thinking the food wasn't bad, it was okay and the location was good enough for another visit. HOWEVER, I WOKE UP IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND THREW UP STRAIGHT FOR 5 HOURS!  I'm talking projectile kind of vomit that shoots up with very little notice that I almost threw up in the hallway before I got to the toilet. I continued to vomit until I had nothing more than froth shooting out of my mouth.  I will spare you what came out the other end because that would be gross. I had to call in sick the next morning when the frothing and cramping continued until 6am and I had gotten 30 minutes of sleep. 

I think you can all guess that I wont be returning. 

Service: overly attentive like you can feel someone staring at the back of your head through dinner, then occasionally have that someone join in on the conversation from out of the blue. I'm not a fan of this. The manager, """"young Liberace/Leona Helmsley face"""", watching us from a distance with face full of botox was starting to creep me out and we passed on the dessert.

"""I was staying with my kids at the Doubletree Hilton around the corner visiting from CA and this was my last meal I had in NY.  Unfortunately, it ended on a really bad note.  

We went there Thursday night, it was quite busy.  There was only one person preparing the food and one taking orders.  First thing we were told is that it might take up to 20mins for our food but we decided to wait.  We were planning to just bring the food back to our hotel. 

I ordered the standard cheeseburger.  Nothing too fantastic.  It didn't taste horribly bad but my bread was a bit stale and the meat lacked flavor.  My son had the mushroom burger and it was ok.  The biggest disappointment were the chicken tenders I ordered for my daughter.  We didn't realize till we got to the hotel that they were burnt!!!  How could you serve burnt food like that!  I will try to upload a picture of that in a bit.  The only thing decent we had were the fries which were ok.  Overall the food looked messily and haphazardly prepared.  You also want to plan on eating outside.  Just by being in there for 7 minutes we already smelled like grilled burger patties when we got out.  Poor ventilation inside.  Worst part of the story....was I had the most worst case of food poisoning I have ever had in my life after that meal and missed 4 days of work!

Our culinary adventure in NY was quite epic....we just wanted to eat something close to our hotel for the convenience.....but never ever again will I return to this joint.""",1
"""Bad service from the start, everything was horrible, worst Middles Eastern -Lebanese dishes I have ever had.  Everything was cold and old- we really felt sick after we left.

We were not given a menu for ten minutes into sitting down.

From appetizers to entrees to desert each time we ordered we literally waited 20 minutes each time. Not to mention everything tasted like crap!
I have never had such a bad service, it was truly terrible.  Chicken and Rice on the street tastes 100 times better than their food.  

The owner is cheap and extremely rude.

There is no way in the world anyone could have had a + experience going here.  I am sure these positive stars by others are fake and made up.

"""I'm writing this review the morning after having foodswings for dinner - right after I needed to call-in sick to work.

I will say I went to this establishment about two years ago and remember really liking the food. Back then, I had a burger and shake and both were delicious. Last night's food however, was not like anything I remember. As the reviewer said below, the food is way over priced for what you end up getting. I ordered the cowboy burger and was given a stale bun with tasteless, messy seitan. The only enjoyable part of the burger was the fake bacon, which having been a vegetarian for almost 9 years I'm usually not a fan of, but the bacon was the only flavorful part of the burger. 

The service was eh. I get that the vibe is supposed to be somewhat pompous so went in expecting that, but don't go in here thinking people are going to want to serve you. 

As mentioned, the morning after foodswings has not been pleasant. I would give it one star, but I do like the fact that it is a pure vegan establishment. Now only if it tasted better...""",1
"The crab and pork soup dumplings are really good, but everything else on the menu is pretty mediocre.  Also, the place is not the cleanest.  I brought my boyfriend here before and he ended up with food poisoning.",1

"I went with a friend; I'm Indian and he's Bengali, so we know authenticity when we see it. The place is cramped, but the atmosphere makes you feel like you're in India. The food is pretty tasty and cheap too. Unfortunately, my friend got sick after eating the chole (chickpeas), so be wary!",1
"The obscenities I would like to use to describe both the food and service I know would not be appropriate for the average reader of yelp... however, I cannot help but use childish descriptive words such as (poopy, doo doo, crappy, yucky)  as well as a quite childish action following these descriptive words (insert finger down throat). Upon entering the kingdom of burger ""heaven"" with two others, we were sent to the back... and then to the back of the back. It was like we were in some type of world where jim crow laws were still applicatable to the world of ...burgers.  After a litttle chuckle between us all we were greeted to the the absurd menu. This is a heaven where a slice of cheese is a mere 1.60 more.... Want fries and maybe some let, tom, pickle??? Well for the low low price of 5 bucks you can get that... welcome to heaven! After I made a wise crack about the price of heaven being to steep for me to the waiter with zero sense of humor , we recieved our food. My burger was a poopy doo doo crappy yucky burger that made me sick by the time I got to the cab which I begged to drive at full speed to my toliet, luckly the driver did just that.

Don't take my word for it - go to NYC gov restaurant inspection page. And the food was greasy.  I usually don't write that many reviews.  When I do, i usually am writing a positive review.   I have a coworker who still goes there.  When a group of us at work talk about it, she admits it is uncleanly.  Every one else, who has gone there, faces turn green in disgust.

"""Well I went to Hop Devil Grill for brunch to celebrate my friends birthday. I saw all the great reviews and said to myself this is going to be great because Yelp is typically on target when it comes to reviewing restaurants. Before I begin to describe all the elements that made this the worst brunch I have ever had, allow me to make the following assertion. Any establishment that has tables, a waiting staff, and serves food, should offer the patrons an opportunity to order a caffeinated beverage. Japanese restaurants offer tea. Night clubs offer Red-Bull and Vodka. Even a frozen yogurt store is likely to offer coffee flavored yogurt. Hop Devil Grill not only failed to include coffee as an optional part of their brunch beverage menu. They lacked the ability to make it. The waitress admitted to us that she, """"broke the machine a month ago and they never got it fixed."""" It was at this moment that they should have lost all credibility in my eyes. But I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. I said to myself this can't get any worse. It's not like they are going to serve us bloody mary's with chunks of horseradish in it that looked more like scum that should be floating in a dirty aquarium than a common brunch beverage ingredient. It's not as if today I might learn that Huevos Rancheros is spanish for """"certain food poisoning."""" If I wanted to eat Goya rice and beans and two undercooked eggs I would have went to the supermarket and prepared breakfast at home. And even I can reasonably expect to cook eggs properly. How do I know? Because I am not a 5 year old with a diminished mental capacity. I would have been better off going to Tompkins square park and joining the smelly junkie bums for the regular Saturday afternoon soup giveaways. Chances are I could have found something more appetizing in a dumpster outside most restaurants in Manhattan. One might argue that 20 dollars for an all you can drink 90 minute brunch is a great deal. I would disagree because no amount of alcohol could possibly have made this food remotely edible. I could have had 20 mimosas and the food would still be way more likely to induce vomiting than any type of alcohol related sickness. So would I recommend Hop Devil Grill? No. In fact if you have no food in your house and 20 dollars to spend, I would recommend that you burn the money and eat a bunch of different condiments that you may have in your refridgerator. And if you have not one edible item to your name just fast. Hold out hope that something better might come along because I promise you hunger pangs are more tolerable then the piercing stomach pains this establishment will cause once digestion begins. 

P.S. The place smelled like piss.""",1

This is what a crazy schedule can do, cause one to lose all common sense!  My physician husband says the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning.  By the way, I had a salad twice (both times with chicken) and a sandwich the third time, ham and swiss, with LTM.  On all three occasions, I saw the employees do the following: scratch their face with gloves on, examine something on their gloves, then use those same hands to make you a sandwich.  Wipe their dirty hands on their dirty clothes. Cough without turning away from your sandwich or salad, or gossip about people in an animated fashion, whereby spittle issues forth from their lips into your food.  Bon appetit!  Also, the staff is SO, SO RUDE, more so than the typical ""dose of attitude"" experience, such as talk smack about you to your face, and the women at the cash registers making fun of customers, ranging from hardworking nurses to guys in business suits.

"""Let me start out by saying that I used to LOVE Taro. It's close to where I live, the service was usually good, and the food was always delicious.

Last Saturday night, my husband and I had a totally different experience. First off, the staff seemed confused. The waiter brought out a delicious platter and identified all of the different fish. Then, five seconds later, he came back and took it away saying he gave us the wrong dish. Luckily we hadn't eaten anything yet. Or maybe we weren't so lucky...

The waiter eventually brought our sushi platter. It looked a little less appetizing than the first one, but we just wanted to eat and we did. The sushi and sashimi were just okay, nothing to write home about. I noticed one of the waitresses was sobbing around that time. Weirdness.

Even though my husband and I only really eat fish, we decided to eat the raw beef that came on our sushi platter because we'd had the raw beef dish there before. I did think it was rather strange that we were given raw beef on a platter with raw fish, but I didn't feel like making a thing of it. We both remarked at how nonplussed we were with the whole experience.

Cut to Sunday morning...my husband wasn't feeling well. He wasn't feeling well on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday either and had to skip out on plans with friends to rest up. Thursday, he went to the doctor only to find out he had Scombroid food poisoning from consuming spoiled raw fish. I've heard of people getting sick from sushi, but I always thought it was just something people said who are afraid to eat raw fish.

Taro has obviously gone downhill and I'm super bummed about it because it used to be one of my favorite spots and definitely my favorite sushi place in the neighborhood. Now, instead of recommending it to friends and family, I'll tell this story.""",1
"""I really wanted to like this diner because the waitress was so great! 

The veggie burger I had was really tasty, and I appreciated that they made it fresh from actual vegetables rather than the veggie puck that a lot of diners serve. And if I were writing the review based only on my own experience, this review would say 4.5 stars for NY diner.

Bc we know that raw oysters are risky to begin with, we still paid full price but called the manager over to leave our two cents with her.

"""My wife and I had dinner at Esca for our anniversary a little over a week ago. We had been very excited to try it ever since we moved to the neighborhood. We absolutely love Italian and seafood, and obviously Esca has a great reputation for its crudo and other dishes.

As usual, since it was our first visit we decided to go for the tasting menu with wine pairings. The crudo comes out first and was good but didn't blow me away. The presentation was nice and the olive oil they used was fantastic, but the fish/shellfish itself really didn't blow me away.

The non-crudo dishes were all decent but nothing spectacular either. There was a razor clam dish, pasta with shellfish, and salmon filet. That's all I remember specifically. I'd eat it all again but wouldn't go back for anything in particular.

So, three stars for the main dining experience (food, value, ambiance, service, etc.). Our waiter was apparently new and so there were a few hiccups related to that (coming back to ask questions he should've asked when we ordered), but that wasn't at all a big deal to us. The problem is that we both got SICK from our dinner, and that is of course a big problem! My wife got sick shortly after we got home that evening, and was very queasy the entire next day (even had to miss plans the next night), while I felt fine the night of but then woke up the next morning feeling nauseous.

We really did have a wonderful time at Esca, so I can't knock it all the way down to one-star (I've never done that before!) but there was just nothing spectacular about the experience and the aftermath was obviously unacceptable. While I'm glad that we tried it, I definitely won't be recommending it to anyone else.""",1

We were also dumbfounded that such a large place only has 2 bathrooms!! Have just received a text from my friends checking to see how I am...they now have food poisoning - both of them.

"""My girlfriend and I, both middle aged and well-seasoned (no pun intended) when it comes to restaurants and food, went to the Oyster Bar Friday 11/23 - right after Thanksgiving, seeking a change from poultry to fish. I had never eaten there before, She had eaten there years before. 

We had our hearts (and mind and stomach) set on raw oysters and clams. Not surprisingly we ordered a half dozen cherrystone clams and a half dozen oysters. In the case of the oysters, we got two of three different varieties.

They tasted great and the price seemed reasonable. We left &#34;full&#34; and content with the experience. Come Sunday I had a full blown case of food poisoning which included all the symptoms, including the more serious chest muscle area pains. Come Monday, she had all the symptoms minus the chest pain.

After reading other reviews of the Oyster Bar which state that the cleanliness of the kitchen is &#34;B&#34; rated and that others believe they too were poisoned after eating here, I decided to post this critique/review.

In all fairness to the Oyster Bar, oysters and clams &#34;clean&#34; the water in which the grow/live of toxins and other pollutants. Perhaps there is no way the Oyster Bar or any other establishment can &#34;guarantee&#34; that the batch they are using is &#34;free&#34; of these pollutants. Perhaps there should be a law requiring a disclaimer of sorts - similar to items that contain peanut butter.
As to the service and other factors (d?cor, etc.) it was &#34;good&#34; (average), but nothing special.

The bottom line though is that my girlfriend and I would never eat at the Oyster Bar again, because it remains possible that the poisoning was somehow the result of their mishandling of the items. Also, we are both nearly one hundred percent certain the poisoning came from the raw food we had at the Oyster Bar as opposed to other great food we had both before and after.

Stay away, or order something cooked!""",1

Half my bowl was cold, the other half steaming.  Waitress told me this is how ramen is served.  Another waitress offered to warm mine up in microwave.

"""I came here last weekend with my boyfriend who had  some good things to say about it.  Long story short, by the time we left he had recanted his statement.  For starters,  we were graced with who was hands down the rudest waiter I have ever had in my life.   The man glared -literally straight up stared daggers at us -throughout our entire ordering process - and every attempt we made to catch his attention after that he seemed to purposefully ignore.   

I was starving - We ordered 2 glasses of wine,  the Entremes Variados appetizer combination for two, and a paella for an entree.  The appetizer combination was god awful.  Bland, tasteless, and really unbalanced, unfortunately that was the least of the issue.  Within 5 minutes I started to feel sick.  Now i&#39;m someone who can polish off a whole large pizza by myself in one sitting and never get sick from a meal.  By the time the paella came I wasn&#39;t sure how confident I was I would not vomit.  I ignored the paella and he ate a few bites before he started to feel sick as well.  We decided to just ask for the check, and decided to tell the manager about our issue.  We gave the waiter our credit card and they wrapped up the paella.  When the manager came over we explained to him how rude our waiter was, and how we had gotten sick from the appetizer.  

  We really just wanted to pay and leave so we could go back to the apartment and be near a private bathroom, but thought we&#39;d let him know.  This turned into an argument about how much paella we ate, when in reality it was virtually none, but he was convinced we ate half of it.   After twenty minutes of arguing with us while i tried to supress my urge to vomit,  he offered to comp the appetizer.  We didn&#39;t even take the paella and paid a check for 50 dollars.  When we got home my boyfriend ran to the bathroom and vomited 3 times over the next hour.  I didn&#39;t vomit but i felt disgusting for the rest of the night.

So essentially, we paid 50 dollars to eat a revolting appetizer, and go home to vomit.  The only positive thing i can say is that there was nothing wrong with my pinot grigio.   I will never return to El Quijote again and advise everyone to be extremely wary of this restaurant.  Avoid like the plague!""",1
"""Got food poisoning by a cuban pulled pork sandwich. oh lord. thought I was going to croak. Mentioned this to co-worker and she said NO WAY! ME TOO!
Was delicious going down, not so good coming up.""",1
"""Got a delivery from seamless yesterday, didn&#39;t sleep all night and all day long i&#39;m suffering from food poisoning! i thought it might be something else, but i just got a phone call from my girlfriend who had dinner with me and she has the same problem!

will never go there. will never order again.

will recommend for the health department to go there and check!""",1
"We ate there hours ago. Bibimbap was pretty good. Probably one of the better  my bibimbaps I&#39;ve had eaten, BUT after leaving the place I got really bad stomach pains and unfortunately my girlfriend and I both had really bad diarrhea. Don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back.",1
Recently brought a party of 6 to this location on a Saturday night. This ranks as the worst experience we have ever had in an NYC restaurant. Service was awful. Server had no idea who ordered what. His helper was basically reaching across everyone and throwing plates and food on the table. Then both disappeared for about 30 mins...our steaks were just Ok but at $45 per I would expect something better than ok...the apple strudel was rancid and two people at our table got sick that evening after dinner.....I would tell anyone considering this location to just go burn $500 in an ashtray and go to McDonald&#39;s for a better meal and service. I will be shocked if this location isn&#39;t closed soon…,1
"Service was good, and everything tasted great. But everyone in my group who ordered a burger rare / medium rare got sick, and my friends salad had a sharp piece of a plastic fork in it. Probably will never patronize this chain again.",1
"""This is really unfortunate.

I came here shortly after this place opened earlier this year. The decor was cool and the menu looked promising. They were out of a bunch of things we were hoping for and the food itself was not memorable. But, I figured I&#39;d give them a couple months to get everything up and running...

Went back recently with high hopes. Friend and I both ordered steak sandwiches and side of cauliflower. The cauliflower wasn&#39;t very appealing, but the steak sandwich seemed really off. Took a peek inside and it was totally raw (or worse?). I told the waitress that I was afraid to eat it and she graciously brought me another a little while later. Slightly better, but more or less the same issue, so I put it aside. Same deal with friend&#39;s plate... 

The staff apologized and brought us complimentary glasses of champagne, which was nice, but unfortunately did not make up for the HORRENDOUS CASE OF FOOD POISONING both my friend and I endured over the course of the next 72 hours. I&#39;ll spare the details. Unfortunately, all arrows point to this restaurant. Undercooked meat? unsanitary conditions? I really don&#39;t know. Doesn&#39;t matter now.  I know three&#39;s a charm, but, Definitely won&#39;t be giving them another chance.""",1
"""Never tried this place before, and it was on my way home from work.   Got Broiled Salmon Steaks, Fish&amp;Chips, and a few sides.   Me and my significant other both got very ill that night.   Still feeling it this morning.   I vomited twice, and had all the other symptoms of food poisoning.   Worse food-related illness of my life.   I&#39;m sure this doesn&#39;t happen to everybody, but obviously it&#39;s the last time we&#39;ll be getting food from them.   Staff was nice, and I&#39;m not trying to get even with anybody.   This place has an A from the health department, so I figured it was safe.  

And honestly, after-effects aside, we didn&#39;t enjoy the food that much.""",1
FOOD POISONING WARNING: we bought beef and pork mince and my child and i were both food poisoned from it. I would not recommend risking buying any meats from this supermarket.,1
"""This was a complete suprise and disappointment.

After walking by this place several times I finally made my way in on a fine December evening for dinner with my roommate.

I was pleased with the atmosphere and the menu.

The food came quickly which I was also very please with, everything tasted really good and all was well.

Around 5am the next morning I found myself waking up nauseous and running to the bathroom. Around 5pm the same day my roommate found herself in the same predicament.

It was just a complete disappointment that everything was so great about the atmosphere, the food, and even the service and they had to go and give me food poisoning.

Won&#39;t be back.""",1
"WARNING, SALMONELLA poisoning from this restaurant. This past weekend, we had a party of 9 people who went to this restaurant (12/8/12).  The next day, 7 out of 9 of the people in our party were violently sick.  We are most positive it was the salad that they serviced with the meal.  I called the restaurant on Monday to speak with the manager and the manager was rude when I spoke with him regarding this issue.  It&#39;s not like I wanted a free meal, I really just wanted to warn him especially if he was serving spoiled food to his customers.  I will never ever go back to the this restaurant or recommend it to anyone, it could have killed all of us and will never risk that again.  Don&#39;t be convinced by the &#34;A&#34; rating outside the door, it&#39;s very deceiving!  The department of health will now be informed.  Thank you",1
Went there for a holiday party last friday. me and one of my colleagues ordered the salmon from the company menu list (don&#39;t know if that&#39;s on their regular menu). i only took a couple of bites because it was super fishy ... needless to day a couple of hours later i got sick and threw up like crazy. my friend got sick the next morning and had to throw up several times as well. either of us was drunk so it could not have been from the alcohol. spent the saturday sick in bed and had a lingering fish taste in my mouth for the rest weekend. lovely!,1
"I got sick after eating jamppong from here last night. My wife is also sick but less severe than me. We order jamppong, tangsoiyook, and jajag bab. I think it&#39;s the jamppong caused the sickness because my son did not eat jamppong and he is fine. Not going back.",1
I am pregnant and got food poisoning last night from this restaurant. Not only did I get sick but my mother-in-law is terribly ill as well. Its christmas eve and I never ordered a stomach virus from Santa! Do not eat here!!,1
"Been going here since it opened however in our last experience. 
We found 4 dead flies in our food. Meats appeared to be unfrozen and refreeze. soap like hotpot. Also health inspector closing this place down due to numerous health violations. Hm and we were charged full price when the place was already closed down by the inspectors. Service was very poor here. There many other hotpot place in flushing, Everyone beware before coming here. After eating the food we were all sick for days.  Check on restaurant inspection for the updated reviews before coming back here. They had almost failed all their grade inspection.",1
"""My friend and I both got food poisoning here today (12/27). It was the first meal of the day for both of us, we didnt eat anything else, and we had the same sickness at the same time. We both ordered the combo lunch special for $10.50 with curry rice, gyoza, and tonkotsu ramen.  

We spend the day with crazy stomach cramps, diarrhea, and on and off fevers. The customer service was great---the waitress was politie, attentive, and friendly. What went wrong was in the kitchen. I will never go back here. I have lived in NYC for 5 years now and this is the only time I have ever gotten food poisoning. 

Outside the restaurant is a dirty, frayed awning. I should have realized that the exterior probably reflected the interior (kitchen) as well.""",1
"""3 of us went... 3 of us got sick 
One on our way home, 3 of us that night, and 2 of us the following morning. A whole bunch of running to the bathroom with twisted stomachs and vomiting happened post Yuca Bar experience. 

We had 2 pitchers of sangria and free shots from some promoters that swore they need pictures with customers to show they weren&#39;t just out hitting on guys but they were. Not good liars either. We handled our drinks well but if our expert drinker got sick... It wasn&#39;t because of the alcohol mixes. We had yuca fries and octopus along with our drinks. The fries tasted nice but the octopus had an unpleasant aftertaste. Maybe it wasn&#39;t fresh? 

It was also the first time ever with this experience: 
Manager: &#34;hi excuse me we have people waiting to be seated. Would you mind we move you to the bar?&#34;
Friend: &#34;The women are in charge tonight. You&#39;ll have to ask them.&#34;
Me: &#34;I have never once been asked to be moved or kicked out of our seats as we&#39;re enjoying our food and drinks. We&#39;re comfortable here. We&#39;re going to stay here.&#34;
Manager: &#34;Okay no problem at all&#34;

What the holy hell? We looked around and there were many other available tables but instead wanted to move us. I advise for the managers to not do so again unless you negotiate with us or any other patrons at that time, by comping either some drinks or food if you&#39;re to move us out of our comfort zone and what was a good dining experience. This is a subpar customer service practice that should be reconsidered before asking another table of customers to move for another.""",1
"""First and foremost, both my partner and I got sick after eating the arroz con pollo. This was really more of a rice salad with chicken then anything resembling true arroz con pollo. Either we had the luck of an off day for the chef or most reviewers don&#39;t have real Cuban food to compare with. The papa rellena, something difficult to get wrong, was mostly papa and no rellena!

This is unfortunate because the staff are great,
The service perfect and the ambiance charming.

Cuban food done wrong!""",1
"""Me and my friends had dinner here last Saturday:

We ALL felt really sick the next day. I really want to like this place, but after all: this is seriously dangerous to your health.""",1
"""Take my word for it, this place is the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.

The good reviews for this joke of a restaurant remind me of the story where these guys go to an overpriced cathouse, where the talent is horrifically ugly, but as they leave the cathouse they do a thumbs up to the other guys waiting outside because they don&#39;t want to admit that they have been cheated and taken for suckers.

We went here for lunch with a party of four experienced eaters of cuisines from all over the world. None of us had been to Oceana, but one had read the Yelp reviews. Now, mind you, we are not a bunch of penny pinchers. As a matter of fact, the wealthiest friend amongst us was treating and he was loaded for bear, prepared to spend plenty and also drink some good bottles of wine.

Let me come straight the point. The good reviews were wrong. I will tell you exactly what to expect if you are not a yokel who doesn&#39;t know good food from bad food.

I&#39;ll describe who would be impressed by this gyp-joint. Imagine a bunch of polyester-suited salesmen from Idaho and their wives who got all dressed up to eat in a Disneyland seafood restaurant. The Disneyland restaurant was a simulacrum of a real seafood restaurant, and five times the price of an average Disneyland restaurant. Because it was expensive, because it was supposed to be decorated like a &#34;high class&#34; restaurant and because they don&#39;t know frozen fishsticks are not the epitome of seafood cuisine, they loved it.

There you have it in a nutshell. Now you know what &#34;Oceana&#34; is like.

OK, specifics. I had the lobster roll. It was disgusting. There were a few tiny pieces of dry lobster and some minced unidentifiable stuff on a horrible roll that was like a dried out piece of three day old brioche from Pepperidge Farm.

We had LOTS of clams and oysters. They were tiny, carelessly shucked with broken shells. Every who ate them suffered diarrhea later that day. 

The branzino was odd and dried out. 

My espresso macchiato was bitter and made from stale coffee.

OH! And here&#39;s the capper. We ordered a very expensive bottle of sake, which was served as if it were red wine, in wine goblets, at the wrong temperature. Bizarre and silly.  I was incredulous. (warning, don&#39;t get the sushi here, unless you think the takeout sushi at Whole Food is wonderful)

Some of the bread was OK.

I won&#39;t go on, I&#39;m sure you got the picture.

If some suburban clueless doofus eats here and tells you it was &#34;amazing&#34;, question his sanity.

PS: Yes, the bill was ginormous.""",1
"Our pizza was delivered slightly late last night, but not too bad. We were surprised at how big it was, which makes the price a bit more understandable. Those pies are huge. It was pretty tasty, too. Not mind-blowing, but pretty good. Biggest problem? My husband and I are sick with food poisoning, barfing, nausea - we feel terrible. Not ordering from here ever again.",1
"""FOOD POISON ALERT!!!!!

We came here for New Year&#39;s Eve and got serious food poison.
We ordered the slow poached farm eggs and the cioppino semolina, which smelled funky and suffered major food poisoning.""",1
"""NEVER EAT HERE. 
I created a yelp account just to write a review for this place. Honestly, the place didn&#39;t seem bad. The staff was nice, the bathroom was clean, and the prices were pretty good. It wasn&#39;t until I left and my stomach started hurting that I noticed something was wrong. After a day went by and it was still hurting, I went to the doctor and it turned out I got food poisoning from eating there. 

If it weren&#39;t for the FOOD POISONING I would have given them a much higher review but unfortunately, that&#39;s a really important factor. 

I really think it was the spicy salmon roll...""",1
"""It was a big mistake coming into this little sushi restaurant. Although the interior looks relatively modern, the restaurant was basically empty, even at peak lunch hours. The menu is relatively small, with basic rolls- nothing too fancy. The waiters are Chinese, so it&#39;s not too legitimate. 
My girlfriend and I got three rolls and a beef teriyaki bento box. The miso soup which came with the lunch specials was probably pre-made from packets. The three rolls were all average at best- the fish was not  fresh and the rice was a bit hard. The beef teriyaki was horrible- the beef was chewy and dry and the sauce was sub-par. Worst of all, my girlfriend got food poisoning from this place from the sushi and had a high fever. 
The only good thing about this place is that the staff is attentive and give you plenty of green tea. Other than that, avoid this place because of mediocre food that&#39;ll get you sick.""",1
"""Do you want food poisoning?  Maybe looking to lose a little weight before spring time?  Come to poco for brunch and order eggs you&#39;ll be sure to have stomach problems for a few days after!

Ordered truffle oil omelette for Saturday brunch with some friends- tasted pretty good and I even asked for it well done since I am always skeptical of eggs that are not cooked thoroughly enough.  Sure enough 5 hours later I was sick with food poisoning and could not go out later that evening. The same thing happened to my roomate who ordered eggs at Saturday brunch a month or so ago- got sick afterwards.

Also- saw our waiter holding a mason jar of sangria picking through it with a straw (his hands that just touched the dirty computer screen and money were all over the top of the straw) and he was using the straw to pick things that clearly shouldn&#39;t have been in the sangria out before he proceeded to put the straw back into the mason jar and take it over to a table.

$38 wasted. EW.""",1
"""My wife and I went here the other night, which was the first time we visited the new location.
Sadly, I am still feeling sick from having a bad meal.  I am starting to feel better but the day after, I was in pretty bad shape suspecting food poisoning.  

I had the 3 prix fix dinner, and I ordered the beef empanadas (which were nothing special) and the steak as an entree.  I suspect the steak was the culprit, which had a slight beefy &#34;odor&#34;-- I thought to send it back but it appeared to be cooked (or even over cooked) through.

I thought the old space was special and had a better ambiance.  It just so happened to be one our favorite restaurants.

We will not be going back.""",1
"I would drink in this bar during many club European games throughout the year. (NEVER AGAIN) On this occasion I was shocked at our treatment from a member of management (Young small Irish guy) A group of mates and I went to see the England v Italy game. We had a nice number of pints before the game and with in the first half. In the 2nd half a member of the group went up to order another two more rounds of beers as it was not easy to order with so many people packed in. When we finished the rounds of beer off there was about 20 minutes left in the game, nerves were high and the bar was packed so trying to order another drink was difficult.  Two members of the group had not put down their empty glasses when a member of management came over and said ""If we were not going to buy another beer then we would be asked to leave. This was not our living room and that the bar was in the business of making money"".  We were shocked to the point that we said it had to be a joke. But he said it again and again, he said he was not joking. When I asked to speak with a member of management he said he was management. When I expressed my view on what he had said to us he informed me to ""shut up"" or I would be kicked out. His tone was very rude and many people around us seen this going on and they were not impressed. It was like he was looking for an argument as he pushed us more and more. This was by far the worst treatment I have ever had to deal with in a bar ( people getting kicked out because they were not drinking lots and fast). We were about to stay for dinner and to order more drinks but we left with ten minutes to go and the 7 of us went next door to see the game out. I will never again recommend this bar as a friendly Irish bar to have a pint in, I will also be getting in contact with the owner to inform him that an Irish manager on his high horse is losing him money. We were not the only ones that he asked to leave. As one customer said to me when leaving ""It would have been more along his line if he would have clean the floor as there was drink everywhere or clean the sick off the toilets in the bathroom"". #worldcup #Newyorkbars.",0
