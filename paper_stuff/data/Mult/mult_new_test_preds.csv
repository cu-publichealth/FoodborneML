Review,Score"""Do you want food poisoning?  Maybe looking to lose a little weight before spring time?  Come to poco for brunch and order eggs you&#39;ll be sure to have stomach problems for a few days after!Ordered truffle oil omelette for Saturday brunch with some friends- tasted pretty good and I even asked for it well done since I am always skeptical of eggs that are not cooked thoroughly enough.  Sure enough 5 hours later I was sick with food poisoning and could not go out later that evening. The same thing happened to my roomate who ordered eggs at Saturday brunch a month or so ago- got sick afterwards.Also- saw our waiter holding a mason jar of sangria picking through it with a straw (his hands that just touched the dirty computer screen and money were all over the top of the straw) and he was using the straw to pick things that clearly shouldn&#39;t have been in the sangria out before he proceeded to put the straw back into the mason jar and take it over to a table.$38 wasted. EW.""",0.033100335"""I'm writing this review the morning after having foodswings for dinner - right after I needed to call-in sick to work.I will say I went to this establishment about two years ago and remember really liking the food. Back then, I had a burger and shake and both were delicious. Last night's food however, was not like anything I remember. As the reviewer said below, the food is way over priced for what you end up getting. I ordered the cowboy burger and was given a stale bun with tasteless, messy seitan. The only enjoyable part of the burger was the fake bacon, which having been a vegetarian for almost 9 years I'm usually not a fan of, but the bacon was the only flavorful part of the burger. The service was eh. I get that the vibe is supposed to be somewhat pompous so went in expecting that, but don't go in here thinking people are going to want to serve you. As mentioned, the morning after foodswings has not been pleasant. I would give it one star, but I do like the fact that it is a pure vegan establishment. Now only if it tasted better...""",0.003809928"i know they claim to offer gluten free food, I have had 2 sandwiches in the past year.. both times I got sick..not sure if they are careful enough for super-sentivities... at least not for me...I wrote the first time off... but after 2 times.. no dice... it is really too bad as I work 1 block away.... would love to hear if any supersentive GF&#39;ers do better than I did",0.003480454"""Touristy so don't feel you need to wear your Choo's for dinner despite the location. I have seen out of town business types eat while surfing the web on the laptop they bring to dinner with them, and really frompy overweight weight tourists in flip flops here.  Bottom line: this isn't one of THOSE UES bistro's so don't bother bringing out your finest. The menu is somewhat limited, salads and meats from all animals. Didn't see mussels or omelets or even steak tartare that you would find in most other bistro's. The wine menu was disappointing and not very sophisticated. We had to send the first bottle of Burgundy back because I've had vinegar that were less tart. They have 4 small tables in the front if you're into outdoor dining. Food:Appetizer: we had the truffel mac and cheese which was very good, and the lobster salad which featured a tough, chewy, overcooked chunks of lobster. For $24, I thought the latter was overpriced considering the portion and flavor. Oh, they forgot to put the bacon in the mac and cheese which would have made it even better. Main course: Sea bass and Branzino - both came with some veggies like roasted tomatoes that went bad threw days ago, and bland boiled fingerling potatoes. Everything was swimming in BUTTER. I walked out of their thinking the food wasn't bad, it was okay and the location was good enough for another visit. HOWEVER, I WOKE UP IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND THREW UP STRAIGHT FOR 5 HOURS!  I'm talking projectile kind of vomit that shoots up with very little notice that I almost threw up in the hallway before I got to the toilet. I continued to vomit until I had nothing more than froth shooting out of my mouth.  I will spare you what came out the other end because that would be gross. I had to call in sick the next morning when the frothing and cramping continued until 6am and I had gotten 30 minutes of sleep. I think you can all guess that I wont be returning. Service: overly attentive like you can feel someone staring at the back of your head through dinner, then occasionally have that someone join in on the conversation from out of the blue. I'm not a fan of this. The manager, """"young Liberace/Leona Helmsley face"""", watching us from a distance with face full of botox was starting to creep me out and we passed on the dessert. If you've been here, you know who I mean.""",0.005758943"*Review for delivery ONLY*I can't speak to the actual service at the sit down restaurant, but damn they're fast with their delivery.  The General Tsao's I ordered (not very Chinese I know) was surprisingly pretty weak; too many peppers, bland chicken, and sauce that was sickeningly sweet... I could barely get through it... but the dim sum that was delivered was great!  The pork buns were more like pork bun bites (or vitamins almost) and were nice and fluffy, with a sweet and savory chunk of pork in the middle.  The chicken feet though were the best though; if they screwed this part up, it would've been a minus few stars.  A bunch of chicken feet in a sticky black bean sauce... so good, falling of the bone.  And the dim sum prices are extremely reasonable.Dim sum for delivery is definitely the way to go here.",0.004989204"1.  Sanitary is what pops into my mind.  I&#39;ve seen a big cockroach run across the floor, and water dripping from the ac vent onto people.2.  Sure the food is tasty and plentiful, but at what price?  I did not get food poisoning eating here, but they need to step up the clean factor.",0.006864598"3.5 I would say the theme of the dinner was truffle! I was not complaining. Came here with  a group and we got to sit at a round table which was perfect. The meal started off with complimentary bread that came with an herb aioli. This was a decent start. There were six of us and we shared the shellfish platter for four. There was tuna, crab claws, and shrimp that were all fresh and tasty. I sampled my boyfriends pumpkin soup that had shavings of truffle on it and it was delish. For entree, I had the wild striped bass which was my least favorite part of the meal. It smelled fishy and tasted fishy. I ate half and thankfully did not get sick. It came with cabbage that had truffle on it so that made up for the smelly fish. Some side dishes that I sampled were the creamed spinach, truffle parmesan fries and mac and cheese. All of these sides were good except I wish the fries were crispier. For dessert, we shared two orders of the ice cream mini cones and the birthday cake. The birthday cake was the star. It was so whimsical looking with a caramelized piece of sugar that had sprinkles inside and cupcake frosting on it. It also had rainbow fruit loop looking pieces on it that just made the dish really pretty. The restaurant itself is gorgeous which made it a special dinner.",0.010097737"a last minute decision to stop in and try s'mac, a place i've been wanting to try because of all the good things i've heard from my friendsthey have a good amount of recommended macs and cheese combinations that definitely sound interesting - buffalo chicken, masala etcyou can also order your mac and cheeses with multi-grain or gluten free pasta, a nice touch if you have dietary requirementsif you don't like any of the recommendations, you can let your creative culinary taste loose and make your ownthere was a decent amount of beers on tap here and bottled beer - mostly craft beers which is bonus points in my book as i prefer this then your typical brands such as coors lighti opted to order the regular 4 cheese dish thinking ""hey this place is known for mac and cheese (hence the name of the place) so their basic dish should be awesome"" - this is where it went downhill for mea lot more cheese in this then i like, at some point it felt like i was just eating melted cheese and no mac - don't get me wrong, i like cheese a lot but not in a liquid form in this big of an amountthe high point of my meal was my beer, ommegang witte - a light, easy drinking beeri really wanted to like this place and walked in with high hopes, but left disappointed and bit sick from all the cheese and not enough mac",0.001095713A policeman recommended this cart.

I ate much more and got sick from it. Avoid this cart.,0.112896425Absolutely disgusting.  If I had not been so hungry I would not have eaten anything.  I choked down the rubber shrimp with a cocktail sauce that had to be at least a year old.  The French onion tasted like a toxic bouillon soup with no onions.

I&#39;ve had some amazing meals at this place, but it&#39;s really lacking in consistency. Last night, I ordered delivery, specifying that everything needed to be vegan. They said it would be fine and, given that they have such a focus on ingredients, I thought it would be. It&#39;s not hard to do pad thai without egg -- or is it? Apparently, it&#39;s harder than I thought. The rest of the food wasn&#39;t so great, either. Even my perennially non-complaining boyfriend mentioned it as soon as our guest left.  The spring rolls, which used to be hot, juicy and delicious with mushroom flavor, are now overly noodly and not very flavorful. The green curry has also gone all boring and standard.Not sure what is going on. Maybe the head chef is sick or maybe they just suck at delivery. Who knows? I&#39;ll try again in a few weeks to see if it&#39;s good again. It used to be SO good!",0.000810038food poisoning. :- 0 ====,0.017912849"Alrighty. I've never been a burger fan. It just doesn't excite me the idea of a ground meat patty laying in bed between two breads, pour special sauce on it, put the blanket of lettuce and tomato and call it lunch and/dinner.  And be hungry 30 mins later. But then I see this undying long lines everytime I passed Madison Square Park and then I learned about this whole world of Burger as a culinary art. It peaked my curiosity,  not my appetite.  so I have been postponing to try this place until my friend dragged me in a bitter cold of November to join the casuality of that long line and the war over tables & chairs. To be honest, the line moves quickly and with patience one can find a table. It ain't starbucks. People will leave after devouring those monsters. Ordered Shack Stack (a burger with the meat & the portobello mushroom) so I can taste both worlds. Friend ordered one with bacon and fries with cheese. Verdict: great hangover food - its fatty, salty, fatty, & salty. And I guess NYC must-eat at. Once.The deep-fried mushroom is crunchy & has a cheese inside. Just imagine my horror: Cheese = Salt = poor my kidneys. *jug on water for a week. Nothing special with the Fries & Cheese. Use the $3.25 to add an extra meat patty. The meat is thin and I personally ordered it rare; why no med-rare!!! I'm afraid medium becomes well-done. Overcook meat = hard&dry meat. Not good. Me a lazy chewer. T'was a burger experience. And FREEEE WATERRRRRR!!!!P.S I didn't get sick.",0.003138181"Another great burger spot where yet again I went with the burger that featured a fried egg (Texas burger).  Not quite as good as the Black Iron, or as messy, but the wait staff here is a riot.  They have a milkshake called the ""Michael Jackson"" and when we asked ""why that name?"" the waitress said, ""because it's half black, half white.""  Hilarious.  Definitely a dive but a great place to stop after a long day of Beekman beers or 13th Step sports.I recently went back and felt SUPER sick after eating my burger... so I lowered to a 3.",0.001874137"Arrghhh. I so badly want to give this place 5 stars. At the same time I want to give it 1 star. Before you stone me, let me explain!The food here is OUTSTANDING. I had chicken over rice that was perfectly cooked and ridiculously flavorful. Five stars by any normal account. While waiting on line they even gave us a free piece of falafel. You will never find a crispier falafel anywhere. The only con to it was that it was actually on the dry side.Why the minus stars?They&#39;re freakin&#39; -filthy-! Dude. I don&#39;t give a damn about eating food off a street cart, or tamales made by some old Spanish lady&#39;s bare hands, or rice cakes cooked by some Chinese woman in a store front that&#39;s the size of my closet. That&#39;s normally great, authentic, culturally rich food. And I&#39;ve eaten some very questionable food in my time. I was raised Filipino, where i learned to &#34;pick off the bad parts and eat the rest.&#34; My stomach may not be totally made of iron, but I can handle food from a place the Dept. of Health would rate a C (you can get away with a lot and still get an A/B, I worked in the food bizz for a few years).The problem here is that none of these dudes changed their gloves once. I saw them stick their hands in raw falafel mix, handle cash money, and the -worst- offense, handle a filthy garbage container covered in wet rancid scrap-food mess to dump it into the nasty C-town dumpster a few yards away. AND NEVER CHANGED THEIR GLOVES. And then! stick their hands in a basket of cooked falafel to hand it as samples to people waiting on line! Wtf!I didn&#39;t finish my chicken platter the night I got it because:a) It was very filling andb) I was busy peeing out of my ass after eating it.BUT. Just to convey how delicious the food was, I STILL ate some of the left overs the next day because:a) It was deliciousb) Someone stole my lunch at work and I didn&#39;t eat anything all day.Famished, I risked it a second time. Yes, stupid, my fault, and like damn clockwork I found myself pooping out everything I just consumed. On the plus side, this could be a really great diet. You get to eat amazing food and dump it all out before your body gets to absorb any calories. Seriously, if it wasn&#39;t for their complete lack of hygienic practices, this place would easily be five stars.Come here if you like the combination of tasty street food and playing the exhilarating game of seeing how long you can hold your diarrhea before crapping your pants. PS. Ask them to change their gloves.",0.008196717"As another reviewer mentioned this is the only Seamless Indian place in Bay Ridge. I had seen the less than stellar reviews but was really craving Indian so thought maybe they were wrong. They are not and I'm so bummed because I love delivery Indian.I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and what I got was a bowl of faded school bus yellow sauce that tasted mostly of cream and oil. The naan was not the fluffy kind I was expecting but seemed more like flour tortillas. It was literally inedible. I called them up and they sent a guy over with a new batch of the exact same crap even though I said I'd rather just a refund because I'd already warmed up leftovers because the oily cream was making me feel sick. I called Seamless and they contacted the restaurant that refused a refund and swore that the food was on par.

I will never order from here again. I ordered fries and chicken fingers, and the guy said it would take about 45 minutes. About an hour and a half later, I called back and asked where my order was. He said they should be there in a minute. I said ok and hung up, only to receive my order a half hour later. At first, the delivery man did not want to make the simple walk up the front steps. I felt that he was just taking advantage of the fact that I&#39;m 14 and thought that I was going to go along with whatever he wanted to do. After I made it clear that I was under no circumstances going to come outside, he reluctantly climbed the stairs and gave me my order. I did not feel like tipping him at all. When I opened the food, I was disappointed. The chicken tasted like no other chicken had ever tasted before; it was the worst. And on top of that, the fries were cold and you could tell that the steam from the once hot meal had made it a bit soggy. It was the worst meal ever, but I was extremely hungry and continued to eat it. But I was a little surprised at how little time it took me to feel full, but I overlooked that. Fast forward to two days later, I feel nauseous and have loose stools, and I feel sick everytime I think about any kind of chicken. I don&#39;t have a loss of appetite, and I doubt its food poisoning, but I am never EVER ordering from this place again, and I suggest you don&#39;t either.

Everything was absolutely delicious and much cheaper than we expected. We would have easily paid double in Manhattan without complaining a bit.Someone complained about the small size of the plates but I think they were nitpicking a bit.

The place was mostly empty and we were promptly greeted and seated. She ordered an Arnold Palmer that ended up being a lemonade seltzer only the first time, then was a splash of iced tea over it the second time. The third time, the waiter poured a lemonade mix or something at the table along with iced tea, which looked much more Arnold Palmer-like but still wasn't quite right, maybe because of the organic/fair trade-type drinks they have or maybe because of a language barrier. But I digress.My colleague ordered a cheeseburger and I ordered a turkey burger with cheese. Normally the fact that the waiter mixed these two up between two customers wouldn't be a big deal aside from embarrassment that we bit into each others burger and had to awkwardly request and either wait for or take out a redo. HOWEVER, I haven't eaten beef in 16 years and took a bite of her cheeseburger, which could make me sick since ones body isn't used to eating beef after a period of time like this and can have a weird reaction to it.We asked to speak with a manager who came over to the table basically yelling at us, already on the defensive. He said he had already ""yelled at the moron in the kitchen"" (which for the record I would never want as it was a human mistake -- not a good thing but just an error nonetheless).

It was pretty bad, even by cheap-Chinese-food standards. The main problem is that, although the portion sizes were generous, there was very little meat. My pepper steak with onions was mostly onions, with only a few pieces of small, fatty, chewy meat. Where's the beef? My sweet and sour pork (yes, I ordered two meals - one for that day, one for the next) was mostly just deep-fried flour and cornstarch. A couple of pieces didn't contain any pork at all. Also, my pork fried rice (which came with each entree) was mostly fried rice, with just a few tiny pieces of pork. (At least, I think it was pork.)I found each meal surprisingly soggy, and the sweet and sour sauce tasted like pure vinegar. (Perhaps they just added red food coloring?) I felt kind of sick after eating the sweet and sour pork. Also, the delivery person lingered at the door for a tip, which was a bit awkward/uncomfortable since I had already put a 20% tip on the credit card. (I used the restaurant's online ordering service.)Now that I've covered the negatives, let's get to the positives: The portion sizes were big, the prices were fantastic (five bucks for an entree, pork fried rice and egg drop soup? Can't beat that!), and the food arrived hot and fairly quickly. These positives simply don't make up for the problems discussed above, and if you're looking for quick Chinese food, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

However, on more than one occasion either myself or someone I was with has gotten sick after eating at Cebu. One night we took a family friend here for dinner and my fiance had to rush home right after because he had stomach issues. Another time I got really sick from eating pasta and drinking wine. Last night I ended up getting sick after eating a few pieces of calamari and 2 vegetable spring rolls. I am quite certain that many, if not all food items, are not made fresh. It is a tiny step up from chain restaurant food.  I love wine and I am a bit of a wine nerd. The wine at Cebu is of poor quality.

Coming from Chicago I suppose my standards are high, but even for New York marble is at the bottom. The only reason for two stars is because it's very pretty. Has a great atmosphere. Although the night I was there they were taking photographs and kept changing the lighting which was slightly annoying during a Saturday evening dinner. As for the food-- we started with the fried oysters. In edible. Literally. I took one bite and instantly got sick I had to spit it out. Which I can safely say was a complete first for me. I'm really not picky so to spit something out meant it was baaaaad. Then I ordered a filet mignon med rare. Nice couldn't wait. So the appetizer was Awful- maybe their steak will be good- that is what they're supposed to be good at right? Uh no. So first I got a strip steak instead of the filet I ordered. Then I start to cut into it because after waiting ten minutes the waiter didnt come back. So 30% of it was fat and the other 70% was well done. Awesome- I'm officially done with marble at this point. But ok, ill try the Mac and cheese because the picture on yelp looked awesome so at the least this has to be good right? Wrong. It was super grainy. I think they use egg in their recipe (largely a Southern thing), which can be good- but in this case left the cheese sauce broken and gross. If it wasn't egg-- then possibly milk that went bad? Either way, not good. So I ask my date are you doing any better? Unfortunately, no. His steak and fries were eh and also cooked improperly. So sad- looked so promising. Worst part is on the way out someone (who I suspected was the chef -- came from the kitchen)... Asked us how our meal was. My date felt bad and said ""great, thanks""...

I asked to have fried banana dessert to go (comes with a bit of green tea ice cream), she refused - because ice cream may melt! I asked why is it any business of hers if I want to eat my dessert outside, she said what if I go home, put melted dessert in the freezer, eat it then, and get food poisoning and return to complain? OK, so I am complaining here about her lack of service or basic customer service skills; don&#39;t see how it is better. If they have such a strict policy (which I doubt) of no ice cream to go, why not offer to make just the fried bananas to go?

After 20 minutes of laying down I got dressed quickly and we were ready to go. I had decided to drive into the city from Astoria since the place was all the way on the Westside. Finding parking in this area was truly a mentally and physically challenging task in itself. After looking for parking for 45 minutes we were starving and walked over to the Spotted Pig at 8pm. Upon arrival to the Spotted Pig I then met our hostess or host? Sebastian. I nick named him Sebastian due to this Diesel Short Short Jeans, poor attitude and poor customer service skills. I do not know what his real name is but Sebastian seemed fitting for him.  Sebastian told us it would be a 90 minute wait for a table. We figured we were already here. Why not? We heard great things. I put my name down; he took my number and said he would call me. We walked around the city for a little bit and then stopped by a bar called the Dublin Pub I believe.  We got a couple drinks and then headed back to the Spotted Pig. We were hoping that the wait time was better.At 9pm we were greeted by Sebastian again. He informed us that it would be another 30-45 minutes for a table. His hands were flailing around and I let my girlfriend handle the situation. I was irritated enough already and do not do well in those types of situations. The bar and place were packed!  Every step we went people were bumping into us. Waiters would walk by with food and we were starving. Luckily I bumped into someone I knew at the bar that was also waiting hours for a table. My girlfriend would walk over to Sebastian every 20 minutes or so hoping for some good news. Sebastian was quite indifferent and did not seem to care that we were waiting for 2 hours for a cheese burger.  He was unapologetic and was doing an awful job.We FINALLY got seated at around 10:15-10:30pm. Yes we actually had to wait around 2  1/2 hours for a table!  The quarters were pretty close and we were basically sitting on top of the people next to us. There were a lot of tourists and asshole hipsters there giving us dirty looks. I am born and raised in New York City and do not care about you. We got our food at around 10:45pm. We got an order of deviled eggs and chicken liver toast for appetizers which were banging. We both ordered the burger that everyone ranted and raved about. I wasn't really impressed with the burger.  It was just a normal burger; the cheese was a bit too strong. The shoe string fries were normal fries you can get at Outback. My girlfriend said she would have preferred a burger from FIVE GUYS or SHAKE SHACK instead and I agreed with her. Over all the food was pretty good but the service and wait time were PUTRID. Sebastian needs a reality check and needs to purchase a pair of pants. I think it's safe to say that all the employees there need one (everyone else was wearing pants). If you want to get a sick burger go to the OLD HOMESTEAD. The Kobe burger is sick. It is expensive but you will get your money's worth and get GREAT service. You also won't probably wait 2  1/2 hours to be seated. I finally got home at 12:30am. 6 hours earlier I wish I would have ordered a burger from the Bel-Aire Diner and relaxed in my apartment in my basketball shorts for the rest of the evening.CHECK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU WRECK YOURSELF SPOTTED PIG!

When they are open, they do not always deliver.Twice in the last 2 months I have called for delivery and was told that they could not deliver that night (I live 3 blocks away.).  Only once was I told a reason: the delivery guy was out sick.  I don&#39;t know if the missing delivery guy was the reason for the first delivery refusal but both times this place lost $40+ of business that night.I would suggest to Yama that they work out their delivery issues and perhaps work on hiring someone who can operate the business during the Sabbath.  I&#39;ve seen the owner and he is ALWAYS there.  Other than the sushi chef I never see any other employees so I&#39;m guessing he must close the business for religious observance.  Of course this is his business to operate as he sees fit but I suspect that not keeping standard hours is literally leaving money on the dinner table to other sushi places in the area which do not seem to be as good as Yama.",0.005044146"I went here with 4 friends before a show and was disappointed.

It's horrible to admit, especially given that I want so much to like everything about this place. And the food actually does taste amazing. But somewhere in between the high fructose sweetness of those frozen margaritas and the vegetable oils used for cooking un organic meats- I am sick every time.

I exited the cab and ducked into Betony, narrowly escaping the rain.I was the first one to arrive, nearly 20 minutes early. After checking in with the hostess, I sat at the bar and took a look at my surroundings. Ornate carvings adorned the walls, motifs stretched across the vast ceiling.***Jack, the jovial bartender with an Australian accent, nudged me and asked if ""gin and I got along"".I was intrigued. ""Why?"" I asked.""Well there was a mix-up with another order and we have an extra Negroni..."" he winked. ***The Negroni washed down delicious bar snacks. Thin, crispy Cabot cheddar crackers and salted bread crumbs. I felt a tap on my shoulder as Sharon was the next to arrive. After ordering a delicious Palma Fizz (vodka, ginger, lime, rosewater ), we were led to our table upstairs and given the menu. The menu begins with appetizers on the left, small plates in the middle and then larger entrees on the right. Frank arrived and the three of us decided to order the following appetizers: foie gras bonbons, fried pickles, and chickpea panisse. Michelle was the last to arrive, as a shutdown of the E train caused a 1.5 hr delay. Since we couldn't get a hold of her via phone, text, email for over an hour, we had no idea what happened to her. The atmosphere prickled with nervous anxiety, the fear of the unknown palpable. After a quick prayer, a deluge of Michelle's texts flooded our phones to our relief. To their credit, Betony's servers were patient and periodically checked up on us to make sure everything was ok. With our party seated at 11pm for the 9pm resi, we hungrily devoured the foie gras bonbons which were flashed with liquid nitrogen and covered in candied cashews and crusted with black pepper. Fantastic. The fried pickles with peppers packed a little heat which cooled off with the yogurt. Our server, Daniel, who used to be a sommelier at The NoMad, presented a dish, compliments of the kitchen. He knew that we were worried sick about Michelle and wanted us to enjoy our dinner. Heirloom tomato gazpacho (zebra tomatoes are green even when ripe) with frozen goat cheese sorbet showcased familiar flavors with unconventional preparation. The chickpea panisse tasted like a crispy spring roll with a puree of chickpea inside. The savory ham went well with the creamy chickpea. When we split the bread apart, billowing wisps of steam gave us a mini-facial. I almost dropped the bread on the floor because it burned my fingers. We immediately spread the butter on the bread and watched it melt into a small puddle. Great crust and a burst of anise-licorice essence from the caraway seeds. The seared foie gras dish is a must-order. Sour collard greens, crispy kale, smooth foie with ham hock and ham consomm’©. Tip: With your leftover bread, sop up the last drop. While we waited for our entrees, we talked about our careers. I'm always curious to hear the different work environments of my friends - to hear what works and what can be improved to increase efficiency. Frank and Sharon, both in finance, have been friends for a very long time and she still has no idea what he does for a living. (He is a product manager for mobile applications at a financial services firm). Pretty soon, the focus shifted to my job. When one asks what I do, there are many answers. Suffice it to say that I wear many hats as my firm of 50 people can be described as entrepreneurial by nature, a perfect conduit for me to take on disparate responsibilities and segue in and out of different verticals. The lack of red tape and micromanaging allows me to focus energies on the tasks at hand instead of worrying about politics and face time with senior management. As long as you get the work done, that's all that matters. The plates of short ribs cut our conversation short. This dish deserves all the hype. The application of beef fat throughout the process has yielded the best short rib I have ever tasted. The fried sweetbreads provided crunch and the charred romaine helped cut through the fat. I almost forgot about the second entree that I ordered, a glistening chicken roasted with chanterelles and Tokyo turnips. The perfectly crisped skin served as a protective shield for the chunk of meat as its drippings naturally mixed with the fragrant pool of chanterelles. I let the hostess know ahead of time to prepare something special for Frank and Michelle to celebrate their recent engagement. Champagne foam with strawberry sorbet and pannacotta with lemon ""caviar"" (comprised of an agar and lemon reduction). The hot mixture gets plunged into a cold bath which forms small sacs that look like caviar.(For rest of the entry, please visit www.scrumphsus.com/blog/betony)",0.026743659"It was my last day in NYC and we were about to go on an 8 hour train ride to Buffalo, and this was a good place to stock up on goodies for our ride. I had my order ready:Everything Bagel with lox cream cheesePlain bagel with plain cream cheeseSesame bagel with walnut cream cheese (good choice Ken G!)Pumperknickel raisin with plain cheeseCinnamon raisin with blueberry cream cheeseI forgot to mention toasted until i ordered the last one, but it worked out, cuz i think if it were toasted and we didnt eat it right away that it would get too hard.The bagels were a good amount of chewy and THEY DID NOT SKIMP at all on the cream cheese. in fact, it was almost TOO MUCH!

I've always been a crazy fan of sushi, going to different restaurants to sample and explore the amazing different rolls of sushi. Never have I sat down at an ""all you can eat"" sushi buffet and spot it empty. I have stepped inside this sushi place twice; once to pick up a menu and once to actually sit down and try their AYCE; both times only had either one customer or none. Worst way to waste 20$ is to go to this place.Let's start with the positive:- The place is clean and small; plates are cute and the furniture is decorative.- Lunch AYCE is 11.99 while Dinner is 16.99. This is a dollar cheaper than Sake (which is pretty much the best known sushi buffet around bensonhurst)- Menu is not that small; it has the basic rolls and appetizers.- Appetizers such as the crab rangoon, which is abundant in fillings, and the fried calamari is delish. But the appetizers totally had us fooled about the sushi.Negatives:- Bland! Most of these things were very bland. The rolls were not horribly made, but the taste of them! I've never ate a sweet potato roll that was not sweet at all!- Other appetizers i hated: Dry kani salad, bland chicken tempura, semi-burnt chicken katsu, Lumpy spicy tuna salad (served with a few slices of avocado)- The best thing about sushi buffet is their unlimited sashimi. Well I could hardly eat it because it was so sluggish and slimy.. I dreaded eating another piece! I felt like I would get some sort of poisoning from this place, but I don't want to be charged for it. The salmon sashimi, especially, was shapeless and poorly cut thin. FYI I ordered about 6 sashimi and flinched at the first one.- ATMOSPHERE? During the daytime, it is bright. During the nighttime, it is bright. There is no romantic feeling, thus bringing a date here would be foolish. The (one) TV played a chinese acrobatic show that slowed my mood down even more. - CUSTOMER SERVICE? Had there been a good waitress, I would perhaps give it a 2/5. Yet the waitress was the only one working in the front with the chef. She hardly says anything, no smiles, no nothing. She and the sushi chef constantly returned to the back to the restaurant, leaving us to feel like the only ones there. (we were technically the only ones there except for another couple). But it made me wonder how long it would take them to realize if someone were to dine-and-ditch. (of course I'd never do it, but their method of running a business is just ridiculous)LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWS. I ignored that this place has a 2.5 rating; my big mistake and my punishment is a stomachache. I predict this place won't last long at all, and I feel bad to say that about someone's business. Get better staff, workers and redecorate! It's not in a horrible location to begin with. P.S. I found a fish scale in my spicy tuna roll.

I&#39;ve had the mussels and frites before and got sick and threw up later that evening, I think from the mussels - frites by themselves are fine though, just a bit greasy. The place is beat down inside, chairs are all assorted folding chairs near the front with some wooden tables and chairs in the midle and back. It&#39;s dimly lit but even looking beat down inside has a nice laid back dive bar vibe to it. I just can&#39;t get over their prices, I mean they have just gone insane. You get a beer and half the thing or more is foam. I don&#39;t recall that years ago and every glass back than was 33cl. I casually mentioned the abundance of foam to the asian girl serving me the drink and she told me it&#39;s &#34;Belgian Style&#34;. I know how Belgians serve the beer and yes I know they pour a big head, but my glass had both the 25cl line and the 33cl line printed on it so why couldn&#39;t they pour it to 33cl for $9??

Could use some drink specials though.",0.002942783"So I've been hanging out in Astoria now for roughly about almost 3 years and am familiar with the Long Island City/Astoria part, the Steinway area (my fave!) and the Broadway into Ditmars part. I've seen Doyle's bar and walked by it now for almost a year and a half at this point...since July when my boyfriend moved up the block from this bar. It looks like a regular, Irish pub from the outside - charming, yet being a Manhattan native I've seen my share of Irish pubs and each time I walked by I wanted to hop in, but didn't because well...no real reason, but with so many bars in the area we just never made it in here.Last Friday I went to my beau's apartment from work, he wasn't home as he was doing laundry to prepare for his bestie from CT who was visiting and staying over the next day. We went in the direction of the Laundromat but realized we had 35-40 minutes to kill. He was flushed, a little clammy and not feeling so great. Wasn't entirely sure whether or not he had a fever, but definitely sure he was a little sick or coming down with something. He wanted a Hot Toddy and felt it would help make him feel better. I wanted an ice cold beer as I had a rough week, so I suggested Doyle's since it's on the corner and right by his Laundromat. SO HAPPY I did. This charming pub has many redeeming qualities:1.) Newly remodeled - I had never seen the inside before so I honestly can't speak as to what it was like before, but now it's got comfy booths, dim sexy lighting (not too dark, just right!), simple/minimalistic light fixtures give it a nice, classy pub feel - was totally surprised as the outside (in my opinion) doesn't match the inside, this isn't a bad thing - just an observation.2.) Bathrooms - Yes, this is a QUALITY. People go to bars to drink, drinks make us want to tinkle. Being able to tinkle in a clean bathroom is all too often a luxury at a bar. I literally stopped in my tracks when I entered a clean smelling bathroom with a squeaky clean new steel sink & faucet, clean toilets, perfectly kept stalls, no graffiti or etchings...it was amazing. One of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen at a bar. Awesome.3.) Prices - Food menu is your average Irish bar foods, but everything sounds pretty delicious and I've heard that the Irish Nachos here are to die for. I'll definitely check them out next time I'm here. My boy's Hot Toddy (and other cocktails) are $6 (not awful, especially when it's heavy handed and well made). Jameson on the rocks is $6 and beers on draft (imported and domestic) are $6 all day, every day and I was really impressed to see Blue Moon's Agave Nectar on tap here along with Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (a Hefeweizen style beer brewed by Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan in Freising, German) which I totally got my boyfriend into. He described it as ""oooh, that's refreshing!"" and he's right. Not many Irish bars have a spectacular draft beer selection, kudos Doyle's :).4.) Friendly Bartender - Friday night the man in charge of the bar was Brendan. Brendan is friendly a hoot and gave me a generous sample of Blue Moon's Agave Nectar in a pretty crystal class. He also makes a MEAN Hot Toddy. If I remember correctly he also had a light Irish accent. Winning.Doyle's is a real neighborhood bar and a great place to WATCH SOCCER on their wall-mounted flat screens, enjoy some food and have a good time away from college frat boys and other annoying folk. Also the jukebox here is FANTASTIC and was churning out awesome music - any bar that plays Johnny Cash and Arctic Monkeys gets several golden stars in my book.

Never going back.,0.018670563"So, this is the best proper taco/Mexican place in the NYU area. All that pretentious fusion or Chinese Mexican food can shove it. The guys who work here are wicked nice and work super fast when they need to. That said, I don&#39;t think that I have ever had a taco from this place. I have only eaten their tortas, cemitas, burritos, and tamales. The tortas here are superlative. They are super moist and juicy. I usually get the veggie torta, and it really cannot be beat. I also had the lengua before, which was pretty good as well. Tortas are my go-to in all Mexican restaurants, and these are amongst the best. I live in a Mexican neighborhood and the tortas here are generally not as good. The tamales are a superb value. For two dollars you get almost an entire lunch. I think that the burritos, especially the veggie ones, can be a bit on the lame side. The cemitas are good, but I prefer the tortas. All in all, if you are hankering for Mexican food around NYU, then this place is an excellent option (Dos Torros gave my friend food poisoning right before finals, so beware).

I was initially a bit afraid of the restaurant choice but let me say, IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!Love the ambiance--it's extremely refreshing! Amidst the chaos of shoppers, piles and racks of clothing, and--did I mention--shoppers. No really, tourist shoppers who blindly veer into walkways while looking in every direction but the right one. It's like being in Times Square where they are all looking up and drifting as they walk and, if you're really lucky, stopping out of nowhere. THAT (that = hellish chaos).And then, whew, air, breathing, it's not a mirage--Stella 34 Trattoria.Already worlds happier than seconds before, the night's experience continued to climb up and up.To start, we had a few vegetable small plates to share. Not only were they super delicious but they were presented beautifully.The plating of the food stayed much in the theme of the restaurant, there was a lot of white with vibrant pops of color. The white dishes emphasize the rich color combinations within the dishes, each one looking exciting and enticing--you just have to dive in!Once you do dive in, it's incredibly flavorful. Clean and flavorful. By clean, I mean every ingredient stands out in the right way--with purpose. It's impressive.The dining experience at Stella 34 Trattoria quickly turns from pure enjoyment to curiosity over every item on the menu. Each item that we ordered was so good it made me want to try all of those dishes that I ruled out in the decision making process. (I suppose that's what brings people back to a restaurant. But in the moment I felt like a four-year-old having a tantrum because I want to eat more than I know I am capable of and would result in getting sick. I literally almost ordered a pizza after finishing my meal because my grandmother's looked so delicious.)Beyond my obsession with the food plating, style, flavors, and overall deliciousness, is the service. THE SERVICE IS REMARKABLE. From the moment I entered the restaurant and was greeted, I knew I was in for a proper evening.You see, I was offered a table before the rest of my party arrived. I was also given the option of enjoying a drink at the bar, or relaxing in the large lounge. When two more members of my party arrived, they were directed to the lounge--""there is a pretty girl waiting for you in the lounge""--I believe that she made a note of my location in her system. (fabulous service and compliment--too sweet!)Wonderfully, that type of service extended to our waitress Sam. She was truly fabulous and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. She was able to have fun with us in a completely professional manner which only added to the exceptional experience that we had at Stella 34 Trattoria.And then there's dessert (yes, I'm back on the food. And while I'm there, my ""Tortino Di Melanzane"" was excellent. I want it again right now as I drool over the photo I took of it). THE DESSERT IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DINNER! It's composed and thoughtful--just look at those textures, yum.THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BEING TOO PREPARED--AND STELLA 34 TRATTORIA OBVIOUSLY KNOWS IT! Shopped too long and don't have time to cook for the family? Just don't feel like sitting down to a meal? Like a moth to a flame got pulled towards the lit display case filled with deliciousness?Yes, they have it all!

The portion was almost too large for a first course that it killed the dish's delicacy. The caramelized onions on top was too sweet to swallow. It covered foie gras' freshness and fragrance (or maybe it was just not there without the onions). I'm a foie gras lover but this was too greasy for me to finish the plate. Pasta - Trofie Nero. Seriously what's the hype with this pasta? It was too salty and had a texture of uncooked flour dough. I can get squid ink pasta way better in taste and half in price. Main course - Steak. The steak was just decent, nothing impressive to please my taste bud.

Now, a few hours later, I feel suddenly sick and have explosive diarrhea. I thought about it and realized this is the only meal where I've eaten something I don't eat weekly in a month (almost everything else I eat is cooked from scratch by me).

It just doesn't excite me the idea of a ground meat patty laying in bed between two breads, pour special sauce on it, put the blanket of lettuce and tomato and call it lunch and/dinner.  And be hungry 30 mins later. But then I see this undying long lines everytime I passed Madison Square Park and then I learned about this whole world of Burger as a culinary art. It peaked my curiosity,  not my appetite.  so I have been postponing to try this place until my friend dragged me in a bitter cold of November to join the casuality of that long line and the war over tables & chairs. To be honest, the line moves quickly and with patience one can find a table. It ain't starbucks. People will leave after devouring those monsters. Ordered Shack Stack (a burger with the meat & the portobello mushroom) so I can taste both worlds. Friend ordered one with bacon and fries with cheese. Verdict: great hangover food - its fatty, salty, fatty, & salty. And I guess NYC must-eat at. Once.The deep-fried mushroom is crunchy & has a cheese inside. Just imagine my horror: Cheese = Salt = poor my kidneys. *jug on water for a week. Nothing special with the Fries & Cheese. Use the $3.25 to add an extra meat patty. The meat is thin and I personally ordered it rare; why no med-rare!!! I'm afraid medium becomes well-done. Overcook meat = hard&dry meat. Not good.

I was in love, I told every tourist who asked me for directions about it. My Italian suitemate told me it was the closest thing to home she could find. I went so many times all the pasta guys knew me. I used to go when I was having a bad day just so the pasta could cheer me up. I went so many times I had a favorite pasta chef, Antoine. He is incredible. I don't know if you could taste the love your mom put into the hot chocolate she made when you were sick, but Antoine had a way of putting that same love into his dishes. He took pride in his work and always gave me extra tomatoes and basil :). Anyways, I went on a trip to London for a month, I came back and the first place I wanted to go was Vapiano to visit Antoine to temporarily cure me from the pain of the sh*t show my trip was. To my horror, he wasn't there. Whatever. I ask the guy making my pasta what day Antoine would be back and he had no idea who I was talking about. This was impossible, everyone knew him. A bus boy told me there was a fight with management and Antoine and 6 others had quit. My heart broke into a million pieces. Every time I have gone back since (this happened a year ago) it's been disappointing. No one cares anymore. They burn the sauce and put like a leaf of basil and one little cherry tomato. All I want is Antoine's cooking. I wish I knew where he went :(",0.151828031"This place is a dump.  While they are renovating they are trying to conduct business as usual.  Later at night they have workman sheet rocking and plastering right over your food, with minimal protection to the food stuff.  Last night a man was plastering a wall directly over the bakery items with barely a sheet of plastic covering the food items.  In another aisle, the entire floor was being drilled at in an effort to lift off the old tiles.  Dust and other debris was all over the place.  But forget the renovation... This store is always a dirty place.  And while I've been shopping here for years, I'm staring to get real concerned abou the safety of the food in this place.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Marie Calendar's pie for 10.00 and found when I took it home it was a mess - it obviously sat on a hand truck waiting to be unpacked and put in the freezer for quite some time.  I'm concerned about all the pre sliced (in store sliced) meats and cheeses in one of the coolers where the stuff looks like its been sitting a bit to long.  Everything in this store is a dirty mess.

It can only be so good. But it has gotten bad recently. Comments? I agree it closes way too early. Support the neighborhood. Stay up until 8. You'll probably make 25% of your day in those two hours.

I feel about this place the same way i feel about Sand Diego's Hash House A Go Go, its just too rich, too much, just shy of sickening. Like those places you eat and seeing food after makes you want to barf. I ate here at about 2 and couldn't eat again till 9am the next day.  But the ribs were cooked to perfection the meat fell right off the bone and was complemented perfectly with the sauce. The pulled pork was great and the mac and cheese had a great kind of savory sour note to it.

Yes the food was tasty and authentic AND I personally love a good ""hole in the wall"" AND can tolerate a little dinginess in my eating establishment, BUT this place was filthy! I even tolerated the people handling my food with their bare, grimy hands, but when roaches started crawling on the table while I was eating, I had to draw the line. I completely lost my appetite so I threw away my food and left. Then I looked and saw that their grade from the DOH was pending. Looked up why and found out that the health inspectors came to the same conclusion as I did!So, I agree with the other reviews that the food is memorable but the unsanitary conditions are unacceptable and dangerous. Someone will get sick, likely already has. I would prefer they increase their prices, buy some gloves for food handling and hire a cleaning service.

I studied abroad in Puebla, Mexico, and one of the things I miss most, and nearly impossible to find at Mexican restaurants here in Horchata, a traditional Mexican drink.  I saw that they had it, and so I made the mistake of eating at this place.  I asked the guy behind the counter if the Horchata was made fresh (i.e. from scratch) and he said it was, in the kitchen.  But after tasting it, I strongly believe it was made from a mix, and not a good one at that.  Very disappointing.  But I could almost let that one go because of a possible miss-communication or language barrier.The food wasn't terrible, and I was starving, so it did the trick, but definitely didn't feel like the best quality.  It looked like slop, and tasted like what you'd expect in a Mexican middle school cafeteria. I wasn't impressed, and though it didn't make me sick or anything, I think there are other better cheap-eats in that area (though Wogies isn't one of them).",0.001280797"This place was packed solid when we went there on a Saturday night - you could tell a lot of Romanian families go there dressed up for a night out.  The appetizers (salad and fried cheese) were ok, and they basically gave you a whole loaf of bread for the table.  The entrees looked amazing when they came out - my mother-in-law got a stewed chicken leg with polenta, my husband got a skinless sausage with fries, and I got the Romanian stew with polenta (one side had cheese topping and the other had a fried egg).Unfortunately, just like several other previous reviews, my Romanian stew was cold.  Not just ""it got cold"" from sitting out - it was obviously from frozen/refrigerated and heated up by microwave.  The flavor was actually REALLY good, but after 3-4 steaming hot bites, the meat in the middle was literally ice cold.  I had them bring it back to reheat.  They obviously just put the whole plate in the microwave, as when it came back, the cheese was totally melted/rubberized on the polenta and the egg was practically hard boiled/rubberized as well.  I took another few bites and it was the same thing:  one bite was piping hot, and the next was lukewarm at best.  I gave up and just ate the polenta and egg - and the egg had an egg shell in it!!At this point I just had to stop altogether.... I'm just glad I didn't get sick.  I really wish I could have given this place a better review, as everyone else had a great entree.  The service was ok and they were apologetic about the cold stew, but this is obviously an ongoing problem and food poisoning waiting to happen.  As an experienced microwaver, all I have to say is this:  stir the food around halfway through microwaving and it will be fine. Otherwise, it was decently priced for a good selection of food.  Also, they don't take AMEX.",0.004425894"This place was recommended to us so we decided to give it a try.  Very nice inside, good waiters, nice menu.

Regardless of whether or not I had gotten sick though, I wouldn&#39;t have returned as the food could most generously be described as mediocre. Whipped Ricotta &amp; Nduja: Three small silvers of focaccia with the whipped ricotta and nduja on top that could be finished in two bites. There was literally no flavor at all. I kept trying to figure out what nduja tasted like, and constantly searched for the taste of ricotta or even the focaccia, but alas - nothing. I might as well have not eaten anything at all. Prosciutto Wrapped Dates: Just the opposite. These were sickly sweet. To the point of having to douse each bite with water. Each time I took a bite my mouth became sticky and hard to chew. The Bone Marrow: Ah, their namesake dish. The marrow itself overpowered the sea urchin. And the bread that it came with was charred to a blackened shadow of its former self. I have a sneaking suspicion that the sea urchin was what made me sick. I&#39;ve eaten tons of sea urchin before (yum), but this time I could sense it was off and the texture was odd. Scary to think their most popular dish could&#39;ve gotten me sick! Blistered String Beans: We needed a veggie dish. Overall it was ok as well. The tiny portion couldn&#39;t justify 12 dollars though. Pork Belly: This was their special of the day, and the waitress really pushed it. As an individual who loves pork belly, I was also disappointed by this. They did some sort of caramelizing to the top and bottom, but when eaten it would turn into a sticky, sticky mess that was impossible to swallow. I ended up having to cut away the caramelized part and just eating the middle. Such a sad waste. Overall, their only saving grace was their tiny pretzel rolls. But the waitstaff seemed reluctant to give us seconds, and quickly took our bread plates away and olive oil without asking if we&#39;d like refills. Such a shame that such an expensive meal was wasted.",0.003943612"Two words: Food poisoning.

The portion was almost too large for a first course that it killed the dish's delicacy. The caramelized onions on top was too sweet to swallow. It covered foie gras' freshness and fragrance (or maybe it was just not there without the onions). I'm a foie gras lover but this was too greasy for me to finish the plate. Pasta - Trofie Nero. Seriously what's the hype with this pasta? It was too salty and had a texture of uncooked flour dough. I can get squid ink pasta way better in taste and half in price. Main course - Steak. The steak was just decent, nothing impressive to please my taste bud. But an average dish was good enough to be the star of the night. My friend gave me a bite of her lobster and I sensed a fishy smell. Her stomach felt really weird on her way home, followed by a rough time in the bathroom. BEWARE OF THEIR SEAFOOD.Dessert - We picked 6 different desserts. They were either too sweet or too bland. The pear gelato was probably the best one because it tasted like pears.Service - One server mixed our orders so my friend and I had to exchange our pastas by our own hands. I understand this is a Michelin one-star restaurant so maybe I was just unlucky.

I'm in scientific research a a university in NYC, and the worm is not toxic or necessarily detrimental to one's health, just rather disgusting.",0.014725706Worst case of food poisoning from this restaurant. I&#39;ve been sick for the last 24 hours.,0.037118841"Worst Korean food and service.  Got sick from old food.  Yukgaejang was old with mushrooms and egg?!  Soondooboo was gray color and just gross.  Banchan was old and going bad.  Kimchi was sour as vinegar.  Overall, disgusting and I paid for it the next day with stomach pain.",0.015601495"Wow, this a shit hole. Two blocks across from Houston street you find this hidden, dark, and smelly place. The first thing the hostess warns you is to beware of pickpockets. When you get inside the men touch you without prejudice, oops. In the bar there are four semi naked strippers where they can be touched for the quantity of one dollar. The vodka was the worst I ever drank, too strong, too cheap. There is a sign that says that you can't have sex inside. Gross, dangerous and sick. Never again.",0.001623298"Yes the pizza is great! BUT its not gluten free! Hello, gluten free is not just a fad for those people who don&#39;t understand what it is and maybe think they will shed a few pounds.  Its a severe allergy! I ate this pizza and within an hour was so sick.  They responded by saying that they are not able to make it a controlled gluten free environment and so contamination is possible.  Ok so lets put that on the menu with a giant note, please.",0.005031379"you&#39;d think that after studying and passing the new york bar exam i&#39;d be sick to my stomach at the idea of sitting in another coffee shop . . . ahh, but you&#39;d be wrong. turns out my comfort zone IS the coffee shop. pleasant people watching, delicious cup o&#39; brew, typically great music, and an escape into my thoughts and ideas. yes, coffee shops are places where i can zone out and read and write to my heart&#39;s content.it was a great surprise to find birch, just one subway stop away from my apartment. i had known of the flat iron location for quite some time but just never made it there. and while i had every intention of making lenox coffee my go-to neighborhood coffee shop, i&#39;m a tiny little gal. and tiny little gals probs shouldn&#39;t go too far uptown into harlem alone at night. (yo, i&#39;m just being real . . . can never be too careful!) hence, my venture to 96th street one sunday evening.i didn&#39;t really know what to expect from birch. but, i definitely have high standards for coffee shops (check out my list - &#34;it&#39;s espresso, not expresso&#34; for all my coffee shop adventures).aside from the fact that i walked in and stood at the counter for a solid 2-3 minutes before i was greeted (looks like a baristo was socializing with some guests), i was pleasantly surprised.the space is significantly large, but not dangerously cavernous (take note, bourbon coffee). the menu is extensive - i noticed a dinner menu and beer, but settled for a decaf cafe au lait. the baristo was super nice and helpful. the music selection was on point. and perhaps my favorite part . . . CANDLES! yes, there are tiny candles at each table. shut up. i dunno . . . there&#39;s just something beautiful about a cute coffee shop, candlelit at night, great music playing. ya see . . . i&#39;d rather fall in love with someone at a coffee shop (or library) than at some random bar. shrug.i didn&#39;t use the Internet (strictly a reading and writing sort of night), so i can&#39;t attest to how good or bad it is.regardless, i plan on being a frequent customer here. and i&#39;m hoping i get better service next time i visit. not that service was terrible - i&#39;m being picky here. but, it seems rather rude to ignore a customer for almost 3 minutes, especially when the place isn&#39;t packed. but, i&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt.",0.003468446Zero stars.    I have food poisoning and just made it thru the broadway play before it kicked in.    Never to return to HARU.    Thx much for the memories but you should get a new rating from the board of health or be shut down.,0.006552002
